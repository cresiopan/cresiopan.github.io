#+title:Org showcase
* Emacs Org export showcase
This is intended to be a demonstration of how Org mode exports an org file to
html. All this site is generated automatically by org mode from an org file.

This also is a way to test how my css style covers the html tags produced by org
mode.

** Blocks
#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
puts "This is a code block"
#+END_SRC

Code blocks can be executed (locally in your machine, provided you have a way to
do so) and their results be showed here or even be piped|redirected to other
blocks as input!

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This is a quote
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
This is an example used for verbatim text
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXPORT ascii
This is ascii
#+END_EXPORT

#+BEGIN_CENTER
This is centered
#+END_CENTER

#+BEGIN_VERSE
This is a verse
#+END_VERSE

You can even write $\LaTeX$ code

** images                                                        :image:tags:

** tables                                                            :tables:
| Product  | Units |
| Banana   |   500 |
| Apple    |     3 |
| Kiwi     |    80 |
| Broccoli |    71 |

** text
*bold*
/italics/
_underline_
+striketrhough+
a^2
x_1

some effects are not visible because I disabled a lot of css properties in my
style, so I need to change them back. However, org mode interprets the text
correctly and generates the appropiate html tags.

** lists
*** ordered
1. first item
2. second item

*** unordered
+ item
+ another item
  * subitem 1
  * subitem 3.4

this list is numbered because the css style makes it to be like that.  I need to
change it

*** check [3/4]
- [X] Walk the dog
- [X] Water the plants
- [ ] Prepare dinner
- [X] Take a nap

Making checklists in org mode is very easy. Also, updating the numbered of
checked items is calculated automatically, you just need to move to the header
*check* and press *C-c C-c* (but first insert the text *[/]* if you havent)
