<p>
The Internet is a computer network that interconnects billions of computing
devices throughout the world.
</p>

<p>
In Internet jargon, all of these devices are called <code>hosts</code> or <code>end systems</code>.
</p>

<p>
imagen 1.1
</p>

<p>
End systems are connected together by a network of <code>communication links</code> and
<code>packet switches</code>.
</p>

<p>
Mas adelante se veran los varios tipos de <code>enlaces de comunicacion</code>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>coaxial</li>
<li>cobre</li>
<li>fibra</li>
<li>radio</li>
</ul>

<p>
Different links can transmit data at different rates, with the <code>transmission
   rate</code> of a link measured in bits/second.
</p>

<p>
When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end
system segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment. The
resulting packages of information, known as <code>packets</code> in the jargon of
computer networks, are then sent through the network to the destination end
system, where they are reassembled into the original data.
</p>


<p>
A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication
links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links.
</p>

<p>
The two most prominent types in today’s Internet are routers and link-layer
switches. Both types of switches forward packets toward their ultimate
destinations. Link-layer switches are typically used in access networks,
while routers are typically used in the network core.
</p>

<p>
The sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a
packet from the sending end system to the receiving end system is known as a
<code>route</code> or <code>path</code> through the network.
</p>

<p>
Packet-switched networks (which transport packets) are in many ways similar
to transportation networks of highways, roads, and intersections (which
transport vehicles). Consider, for example, a factory that needs to move a
large amount of cargo to some destination warehouse located thousands of
kilometers away. At the factory, the cargo is segmented and loaded into a
fleet of trucks. Each of the trucks then independently travels through the
network of highways, roads, and intersections to the destination
warehouse. At the destination warehouse, the cargo is unloaded and grouped
with the rest of the cargo arriving from the same shipment.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-editar"><code>Thus, in many ways, packets are analogous to trucks, communication links are</code>
<code>analogous to highways and roads, packet switches are analogous to</code>
<code>intersections, and end systems are analogous to buildings.</code>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Just as a truck takes a path through the transportation network, a packet
takes a path through a computer network.
</p>

<p>
End systems access the Internet through Internet Service Providers (ISPs),
including residential ISPs such as local cable or telephone companies;
corporate ISPs; university ISPs; ISPs that provide WiFi access in airports,
hotels, coffee shops, and other public places; and cellular data ISPs,
providing mobile access to our smartphones and other devices.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Each ISP is in itself a network of packet switches and communication links.
</p>

<p>
ISPs provide a variety of types of network access to the end systems,
including residential broadband access such as cable modem or DSL,
high-speed local area network access, and mobile wireless access.
</p>

<p>
ISPs also provide ­ Internet access to content providers, connecting Web
sites and video servers directly to the Internet.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Internet is all about connecting end systems to each other, so the ISPs
that provide access to end systems must also be interconnected.  These
lower-tier ISPs are interconnected through national and international
upper-tier ISPs such as Level 3 Communications, AT&amp;T, Sprint, and NTT. An
upper-tier ISP consists of high-speed routers interconnected with high-speed
fiber-optic links. Each ISP network, whether upper-tier or lower-tier,
ismanaged independently, runs the IP protocol (see below), and conforms to
certain naming and address conventions.
</p>

<p>
End systems, packet switches, and other pieces of the Internet run
<code>protocols</code> that control the sending and receiving of information within the
Internet.
</p>

<p>
The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP) are
two of the most important protocols in the Internet. The IP protocol
specifies the format of the packets that are sent and received among routers
and end systems. The Internet’s principal protocols are collectively known
as TCP/IP.
</p>

<p>
Internet ­ standards are developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF) [IETF 2016]. The IETF standards documents are called requests for
comments (RFCs) .

<p>
La internet tambien se puede describir como una infraestructura que provee
servicios a aplicaciones.
</p>

<p>
In addition to traditional applications such as e-mail and Web surfing,
Internet applications include mobile smartphone and tablet applications,
including:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Internet messaging,</li>
<li>mapping with real-time road-traffic information,</li>
<li>music streaming from the cloud,</li>
<li>movie and television streaming,</li>

<li>video conferencing,</li>
<li>multi-person games,</li>
<li>location-based recommendation systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The applications are said to be <code>distributed applications</code>, since they
involve multiple end systems that exchange data with each other.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Internet applications run on end systems- they do not run in the packet
switches in the network core. Although packet switches facilitate the
exchange of data among end systems, they are not concerned with the
application that is the source or sink of data.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
Let’s explore a little more what we mean by an infrastructure that provides ­
services to applications. How does one program running on one end system
instruct the Internet to deliver data to another program running on another
end system?
</p>

<p>
End systems attached to the Internet provide a socket interface that
specifies how a program running on one end system asks the Internet
infrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination program running on
another end system.
</p>

<p>
This Internet socket interface is a set of rules that the sending program
must follow so that the Internet can deliver the data to the destination
program.
</p>

<p>
Suppose Alice wants to send a letter to Bob using the postal service.  Alice,
of course, can’t just write the letter (the data) and drop the letter out her
window. Instead, the postal service requires that Alice put the letter in an
envelope; write Bob’s full name, address, and zip code in the center of the
envelope; seal the envelope; put a stamp in the upper-right-hand corner of
the envelope; and finally, drop the envelope into an official postal service
mailbox.
</p>

<p>
Thus, the postal service has its own “postal service interface,” or set of
rules, that Alice must follow to have the postal service deliver her letter
to Bob. In a similar manner, the Internet has a socket interface that the
program sending data must follow to have the Internet deliver the data to
the program that will receive the data.
</p>

<p>
The postal service, of course, provides more than one service to its
customers. It provides express delivery, reception confirmation, ordinary
use, and many more services. In a similar manner, the Internet provides
multiple services to its applications.

<h4 id="orgaae594d"><span class="section-number-4">2.1.1</span> Home Access: DSL, Cable, FTTH, Dial-Up, and Satellite</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-1">
<p>
let’s begin our overview of access networks by considering how homes
connect to the Internet.
</p>

<p>
the two most prevalent types of broadband residential access are digital
subscriber line (DSL) and cable.
</p>

<p>
A residence typically obtains DSL Internet access from the same local
telephone company (telco) that provides its wired local phone access. Thus,
when DSL is used, a customer’s telco is also its ISP.
</p>

<p>
each customer’s DSL modem uses the existing telephone line to exchange data
with a digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) located in the
telco’s local central office (CO). The home’s DSL modem takes digital data
and translates it to high-frequency tones for transmission over telephone
wires to the CO; the analog signals from many such houses are translated
back into digital format at the DSLAM.
</p>

<p>
The residential telephone line carries both data and traditional telephone
signals simultaneously, which are encoded at different frequencies:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A high-speed downstream channel, in the 50 kHz to 1 MHz band</li>
<li>A medium-speed upstream channel, in the 4 kHz to 50 kHz band</li>
<li>An ordinary two-way telephone channel, in the 0 to 4 kHz band</li>
</ul>

<p>
imagen 1.5
</p>

<p>
This approach makes the single DSL link appear as if there were three
separate links, so that a telephone call and an Internet connection can
share the DSL link at the same time.
</p>

<p>
On the customer side, a splitter separates the data and telephone signals
arriving to the home and forwards the data signal to the DSL modem. On the
telco side, in the CO, the DSLAM separates the data and phone signals and
sends the data into the Internet. Hundreds or even thousands of households
connect to a single DSLAM
</p>

<p>
While DSL makes use of the telco’s existing local telephone infrastructure,
cable Internet access makes use of the cable television company’s existing
cable television infrastructure. A residence obtains cable Internet access
from the same company that provides its cable television
</p>

<p>
fiber optics connect the cable head end to neighborhood-level junctions,
from which traditional coaxial cable is then used to reach individual
houses and apartments. Each neighborhood junction typically supports 500 to
5,000 homes. Because both fiber and coaxial cable are employed in this
system, it is often referred to as hybrid fiber coax (HFC).
</p>

<p>
imagen 1.6
</p>

<p>
Cable internet access requires special modems, called cable modems. As with
a DSL modem, the cable modem is typically an external device and connects to
the home PC through an Ethernet port.
</p>

<p>
At the cable head end, the cable modem termination system (CMTS) serves a
similar function as the DSL network’s DSLAM-turning the analog signal sent
from the cable modems in many downstream homes back into digital
format. Cable modems divide the HFC network into two channels, a downstream
and an upstream channel.
</p>

<p>
As with DSL, access is typically asymmetric, with the downstream channel
typically allocated a higher transmission rate than the upstream channel.
</p>

<p>
The [[DOCSIS] 2.0 standard defines downstream rates up to 42.8 Mbps and
upstream rates of up to 30.7 Mbps. As in the case of DSL networks, the
maximum achievable rate may not be realized due to lower contracted data
rates or media impairments.
</p>

<p>
One important characteristic of cable Internet access is that it is a
<code>shared broadcast medium</code>. In particular, every packet sent by the head end
travels downstream on every link to every home and every packet sent by a
home travels on the upstream channel to the head end. For this reason, if
several users are simultaneously downloading a video file on the downstream
channel, the actual rate at which each user receives its video file will be
significantly lower than the aggregate cable downstream rate. On the other
hand, if there are only a few active users and they are all Web surfing,
then each of the users may actually receive Web pages at the full cable
downstream rate, because the users will rarely request a Web page at
exactly the same time. Because the upstream channel is also shared, a
distributed multiple access protocol is needed to coordinate transmissions
and avoid collisions. Mas en capitulo 6.
</p>

<p>
An up-and-coming technology that provides even higher speeds is <code>fiber to
    the home (FTTH)</code>. FTTH provides an optical fiber path from the CO directly
to the home.
</p>

<p>
There are several competing technologies for optical distribution from the
CO to the homes.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The simplest optical distribution network is called direct fiber, with one
fiber leaving the CO for each home.</li>
<li>More commonly, each fiber leaving the central office is actually shared by
many homes; it is not until the fiber gets relatively close to the homes
that it is split into individual customer-specific fibers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are two competing optical-distribution network architectures that
perform this splitting:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>active optical networks (AONs) and</li>
<li>passive optical networks (PONs).</li>
</ul>

<p>
imagen 1.7
</p>

<p>
Each home has an optical network terminator (ONT), which is connected by
dedicated optical fiber to a neighborhood splitter. The splitter combines a
number of homes (typically less than 100) onto a single, shared optical
fiber, which connects to an optical line ­ terminator (OLT) in the telco’s
CO. The OLT, providing conversion between optical and electrical signals,
connects to the Internet via a telco router. In the home, users connect a
home router (typically a wireless router) to the ONT and access the ­
Internet via this home router. In the PON architecture, all packets sent
from OLT to the splitter are replicated at the splitter (similar to a cable
head end).
</p>

<p>
Two other access network technologies are also used to provide Internet
access to the home. In locations where DSL, cable, and FTTH are not
available (e.g., in some rural settings),
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a satellite link can be used to connect a residence to the Internet at
speeds of more than 1 Mbps; StarBand and HughesNet are two such satellite
access providers.</li>
<li>Dial-up access over traditional phone lines is based on the same model as
DSL-a home modem connects over a phone line to a modem in the ISP.
Compared with DSL and other broadband access networks, dial-up access is
excruciatingly slow at 56 kbps.</li>

On corporate and university campuses, and increasingly in home settings, a
local area network (LAN) is used to connect an end system to the edge

<p>
Although there are many types of LAN technologies, Ethernet is by far the
most prevalent access technology in corporate, university, and home
networks.
</p>

<p>

<p>
Ethernet users use twisted-pair copper wire to connect to an Ethernet
switch, a technology discussed in detail in Chapter 6.
</p>

<p>
The Ethernet switch, or a network of such interconnected switches, is then
in turn connected into the larger Internet. With Ethernet access, users
typically have 100 Mbps or 1 Gbps access to the Ethernet switch, whereas
servers may have 1 Gbps or even 10 Gbps access.
</p>

<p>
In a wireless LAN setting, wireless users transmit/receive packets to/from
an access point that is connected into the enterprise’s network (most
likely using wired Ethernet), which in turn is connected to the wired
Internet.

Increasingly, devices such as iPhones and Android devices are being used to
message, share photos in social networks, watch movies, and stream music

that is operated by the cellular network provider. Unlike WiFi, a user need

meters) of the base station.

Telecommunications companies have made enormous investments in so-called
third-generation (3G) wireless, which provides packet-switched wide-area
wireless Internet access at speeds in excess of 1 Mbps. But even
higher-speed wide-area access technologies-a fourth-generation (4G) of
wide-area wireless networks-are already being deployed. LTE (for “Long-Term

electromagnetic waves or optical pulses across a <code>physical medium</code>. The

In cable television and cable Internet access, the transmitter shifts the
digital signal to a specific frequency band, and the resulting analog
signal is sent from the transmitter to one or more receivers.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-4">
<p>
Radio channels carry signals in the electromagnetic spectrum. They are an
attractive medium because they require no physical wire to be installed,
can penetrate walls, provide connectivity to a mobile user,and can
potentially carry a signal for long distances. The characteristics of a
radio channel depend significantly on the propagation environment and the
distance over which a signal is to be carried.
</p>

<p>
Environmental considerations determine path loss and shadow fading (which
decrease the signal strength as the signal travels over a distance and
around/through obstructing objects), multipath fading (due to signal
reflection off of interfering objects), and interference (due to other
transmissions and electromagnetic signals).
</p>

<p>
Terrestrial radio channels can be broadly classified into three groups:
those that operate over very short distance (e.g., with one or two meters);
those that operate in local areas, typically spanning from ten to a few
hundred meters; and those that operate in the wide area, spanning tens of
kilometers. Personal devices such as wireless headsets, keyboards, and
medical devices operate over short distances; the wireless LAN technologies
described in Section 1.2.1 use local-area radio channels; the cellular
access technologies use wide-area radio channels.

transmitter/ receivers, known as ground stations. The satellite receives
transmissions on one frequency band, regenerates the signal using a
repeater (discussed below), and transmits the signal on another
frequency. Two types of satellites are used in communications:
geostationary satellites and low-earth orbiting (LEO) satellites.
</p>

<p>
Geostationary satellites permanently remain above the same spot on
Earth. This stationary presence is achieved by placing the satellite in
orbit at 36,000 kilometers above Earth’s surface. This huge distance from
ground station through satellite back to ground station introduces a
substantial signal propagation delay of 280 milliseconds. Nevertheless,
satellite links, which can operate at speeds of hundreds of Mbps, are often
used in areas without access to DSL or cable-based Internet access.
</p>

<p>
LEO satellites are placed much closer to Earth and do not remain
permanently above one spot on Earth.  They rotate around Earth (just as the
Moon does) and may communicate with each other, as well as with ground
stations. To provide continuous coverage to an area, many satellites need
to be placed in orbit. There are currently many low-altitude communication
systems in development.

<p>
There are two fundamental approaches to moving data through a network of
links and switches: circuit switching and packet switching.
</p>

<h3 id="org5590a13"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> Packet Switching</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
In a network application, end systems exchange <code>messages</code> with each
other. Messages can contain anything the application designer
wants. Messages may perform a control function or can contain data, such as
an e-mail message, a JPEG image, or an MP3 audio file.
</p>

<p>
To send a message from a source end system to a destination end system, the
source breaks long messages into smaller chunks of data known as
<code>packets</code>. Between source and destination, each packet travels through
communication links and <code>packet switches</code> (for which there are two
predominant types, <code>routers</code> and <code>link-layer switches</code>).
</p>

<p>
Packets are transmitted over each communication link at a rate equal to the
full transmission rate of the link. So, if a source end system or a packet
switch is sending a packet of L bits over a link with transmission rate R
bits/sec, then the time to transmit the packet is L / R seconds.
</p>

<h4 id="org1c822b5"><span class="section-number-4">3.1.1</span> Transmision Store-and-Forward</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-1">
<p>
Store-and-forward transmission means that the packet switch must receive
the entire packet before it can begin to transmit the first bit of the
packet onto the outbound link.
</p>

<p>
imagen 1.11
</p>

<p>
A router will typically have many incident links, since its job is to
switch an incoming packet onto an outgoing link; in this simple example,
the router has the rather simple task of transferring a packet from one
(input) link to the only other attached link. In this example, the source
has three packets, each consisting of L bits, to send to the destination.
</p>

<p>
the router cannot transmit the bits it has received; instead it must first
buffer (i.e., “store”) the packet’s bits.
</p>

<p>
Only after the router has received all of the packet’s bits can it begin to
transmit (i.e., “forward”) the packet onto the outbound link.
</p>

<p>
Let’s now consider the general case of sending one packet from source to
destination over a path consisting of N links each of rate R (thus, there
are N-1 routers between source and destination).  Applying the same logic
as above, we see that the end-to-end delay is:
</p>

<p>
d<sub>end-to-end</sub> = N(\frac{L}{R})

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-2">
<p>
Each packet switch has multiple links attached to it. For each attached
link, the packet switch has an output buffer (also called an output queue),
which stores packets that the router is about to send into that link. The
output buffers play a key role in packet switching. If an arriving packet
needs to be transmitted onto a link but finds the link busy with the
transmission of another packet, the arriving packet must wait in the output
buffer. Thus, in addition to the store-and-forward delays, packets suffer
output buffer <code>queuing delays</code>. These delays are variable and depend on the
level of congestion in the network.
</p>

<p>
an arriving packet may find that the buffer is completely full with other
packets waiting for transmission, lo que provoca <code>packet loss</code>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-3">
<p>
a router takes a packet arriving on one of its attached communication links
and forwards that packet onto another one of its attached communication
links. But how does the router determine which link it should forward the
packet onto?
</p>

<p>
In the Internet, every end system has an address called an IP address. When
a source end system wants to send a packet to a destination end system, the
source includes the destination’s IP address in the packet’s header.
</p>

<p>
As with postal addresses, this address has a hierarchical structure. When a
packet arrives at a router in the network, the router examines a portion of
the packet’s destination address and forwards the packet to an adjacent
router. More specifically, each router has a <code>forwarding table</code> that maps
destination addresses (or portions of the destination addresses) to that
router’s outbound links.  When a packet arrives at a router, the router
examines the address and searches its forwarding table, using this
destination address, to find the appropriate outbound link. The router then
directs the packet to this outbound link.
</p>

<p>
The end-to-end routing process is analogous to a car driver who does not
use maps but instead prefers to ask for directions.
</p>

<p>
a router uses a packet’s destination address to index a forwarding table
and determine the appropriate outbound link. But this statement begs yet
another question: How do forwarding tables get set? Are they configured by
hand in each and every router, or does the Internet use a more automated
procedure? This issue will be studied in depth in Chapter 5.
</p>

<p>
the Internet has a number of special <code>routing protocols</code> that are used to
automatically set the forwarding tables. A routing protocol may, for
example, determine the shortest path from each router to each destination
and use the shortest path results to configure the forwarding tables in the
routers.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
In circuit-switched networks, the resources needed along a path (buffers,
link transmission rate) to provide for communication between the end systems
are reserved for the duration of the communication session between the end
systems.
</p>

<p>
In packet-switched networks, these resources are not reserved; a session’s
messages use the resources on demand and, as a consequence, may have to wait
(that is, queue) for access to a communication link.
</p>

<p>
Before the sender can send the information, the network must establish a
connection between the sender and the receiver. This is a bona fide
connection for which the switches on the path between the sender and
receiver maintain connection state for that connection. In the jargon of
telephony, this connection is called a <code>circuit</code>.

<h4 id="orgd99f80b"><span class="section-number-4">3.2.1</span> Multiplexing in Circuit-Switched Networks</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-2-1">
<p>
A circuit in a link is implemented with either frequency-division
multiplexing (FDM) or time-division multiplexing (TDM).
</p>

<p>
With FDM, the frequency spectrum of a link is divided up among the
connections established across the link. Specifically, the link dedicates a
frequency band to each connection for the duration of the connection. FM
radio stations also use FDM to share the frequency spectrum between 88 MHz
and 108 MHz, with each station being allocated a specific frequency band.
</p>

<p>
For a TDM link, time is divided into frames of fixed duration, and each
frame is divided into a fixed number of time slots. When the network
establishes a connection across a link, the network dedicates one time slot
in every frame to this connection. These slots are dedicated for the sole
use of that connection, with one time slot available for use (in every
frame) to transmit the connection’s data.
</p>

<p>
imagen 1.14
</p>

<p>
With FDM, each circuit continuously gets a fraction of the bandwidth. With
TDM, each circuit gets all of the bandwidth periodically during brief
intervals of time (that is, during slots)
</p>

<p>
Proponents of packet switching have always argued that circuit switching is
wasteful because the dedicated circuits are idle during <code>silent
    periods</code>. For example, when one person in a telephone call stops talking,
the idle network resources (frequency bands or time slots in the links
along the connection’s route) cannot be used by other ongoing connections.
</p>

<p>
Proponents of packet switching also enjoy pointing out that establishing
end-to-end circuits and reserving end-to-end transmission capacity is
complicated and requires complex signaling software to coordinate the
operation of the switches along the end-to-end path.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-2-2">
<p>
Critics of packet switching have often argued that packet switching is not
suitable for real-time services (for example, telephone calls and video
conference calls) because of its variable and unpredictable end-to-end
delays (due primarily to variable and unpredictable queuing delays).
</p>

<p>
Proponents of packet switching argue that (1) it offers better sharing of
transmission capacity than circuit switching and (2) it is simpler, more
efficient, and less costly to implement than circuit switching.
</p>



<p>
Circuit switching pre-allocates use of the transmission link regardless of
demand, with allocated but unneeded link time going unused.
</p>

<p>
Packet switching on the other hand allocates link use on demand. Link
transmission capacity will be shared on a packet-by-packet basis only among
those users who have packets that need to be transmitted over the link.

Recall that the overarching goal is to interconnect the access ISPs so that
all end systems can send packets to each other.
</p>

<p>
One naive approach would be to have each access ISP directly connect with
every other access ISP. Such a <code>mesh design</code> is, of course, much too costly
for the access ISPs, as it would require each access ISP to have a separate
communication link to each of the hundreds of thousands of other access ISPs
all over the world.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Network Structure 1</dt><dd>interconnects all of the access ISPs with a single
global transit ISP. Our (imaginary) global transit ISP is a network of
routers and communication links that not only spans the globe, but also
has at least one router near each of the hundreds of thousands of
access ISPs. Of course, it would be very costly for the global ISP to
build such an extensive network. To be profitable, it would naturally
charge each of the access ISPs for connectivity, with the pricing
reflecting (but not necessarily directly proportional to) the amount of
traffic an access ISP exchanges with the global ISP. Since the access
ISP pays the global transit ISP, the access ISP is said to be a
customer and the global transit ISP is said to be a provider.</dd>

<dt>Network Structure 2</dt><dd><p>
which consists of the hundreds of thousands of
access ISPs and multiple global ­ transit ISPs. The access ISPs
certainly prefer Network Structure 2 over Network Structure 1 since
they can now choose among the competing global transit providers as a
function of their pricing and services. Note, however, that the global
transit ISPs themselves must interconnect: Otherwise access ISPs
connected to one of the global transit providers would not be able to
communicate with access ISPs connected to the other global transit
providers.
</p>

<p>
is a two-tier hierarchy with global transit providers residing at the
top tier and access ISPs at the bottom tier. This assumes that global
transit ISPs are not only capable of getting close to each and every
access ISP, but also find it economically desirable to do so. In
reality, although some ISPs do have impressive global coverage and do
directly connect with many access ISPs, no ISP has presence in each and
every city in the world. Instead, in any given region, there may be a
<code>regional ISP</code> to which the access ISPs in the region connect. Each
regional ISP then connects to tier-1 ISPs. Tier-1 ISPs are similar to
our (imaginary) global transit ISP; but tier-1 ISPs, which actually do
exist, do not have a presence in every city in the world.
</p></dd>

<dt>Network Structure 3</dt><dd><p>
not only are there multiple competing tier-1 ISPs,
there may be multiple competing regional ISPs in a region. In such a
hierarchy, each access ISP pays the regional ISP to which it connects,
and each regional ISP pays the tier-1 ISP to which it connects. (An
access ISP can also connect directly to a tier-1 ISP, in which case it
pays the tier-1 ISP). Thus, there is customer- provider relationship at
each level of the hierarchy. Note that the tier-1 ISPs do not pay
anyone as they are at the top of the hierarchy. To further complicate
matters, in some regions, there may be a larger regional ISP (possibly
spanning an entire country) to which the smaller regional ISPs in that
region connect; the larger regional ISP then connects to a tier-1
ISP. For example, in China, there are access ISPs in each city, which
connect to provincial ISPs, which in turn connect to national ISPs,
which finally connect to tier-1 ISPs.

tier-1 ISPs, PoPs, multi-homing, peering, and IXPs
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>Points of presence (PoPs)</code>: PoPs exist in all levels of the
hierarchy, except for the bottom (access ISP) level. A PoP is simply
a group of one or more routers (at the same location) in the
provider’s network where customer ISPs can connect into the provider
ISP. For a customer network to connect to a provider’s PoP, it can
lease a high-speed link from a third-party telecommunications
provider to directly connect one of its routers to a router at the
PoP.</li>
<li><code>Multi-home</code>: Any ISP (except for tier-1 ISPs) may choose to
multi-home, that is, to connect to two or more provider ISPs. So, for
example, an access ISP may multi-home with two regional ISPs, or it
may multi-home with two regional ISPs and also with a tier-1
ISP. Similarly, a regional ISP may multi-home with multiple tier-1
ISPs. When an ISP multi-homes, it can continue to send and receive
packets into the Internet even if one of its providers has a failure.</li>
<li><code>Peering</code>: The amount that a customer ISP pays a provider ISP
reflects the amount of traffic it exchanges with the provider. To
reduce these costs, a pair of nearby ISPs at the same level of the
hierarchy can peer, that is, they can directly connect their networks
together so that all the traffic between them passes over the direct
connection rather than through upstream intermediaries. When two ISPs
peer, it is typically settlement-free, that is, neither ISP pays the
other. As noted earlier, tier-1 ISPs also peer with one another,
settlement-free.</li>
<li><code>Internet Exchange Point (IXP)</code>: a third-party company can create an
Internet Exchange Point (IXP), which is a meeting point where
multiple ISPs can peer together. An IXP is typically in a stand-alone

<dt>Network Structure 5</dt><dd><p>
describes today’s Internet. builds on top of
Network Structure 4 by adding <code>content-provider networks</code> or <code>content
     delivery networks</code>.
</p>

<p>
Google is currently one of the leading examples of such a
content-provider network. As of this writing, it is estimated that
Google has 50–100 data centers distributed across North America,
Europe, Asia, South America, and Australia. Some of these data centers
house over one hundred thousand servers, while other data centers are
smaller, housing only hundreds of servers. The Google data centers are
all interconnected via Google’s private TCP/IP network, which spans the
entire globe but is nevertheless separate from the public
Internet. Importantly, the Google private network only carries traffic
to/from Google servers. As shown in Figure 1.15, the Google private
network attempts to “bypass” the upper tiers of the Internet by peering
(settlement free) with lower-tier ISPs, either by directly connecting
with them or by connecting with them at IXPs.
</p>

<p>
However, because many access ISPs can still only be reached by
transiting through tier-1 networks, the Google network also connects to
tier-1 ISPs, and pays those ISPs for the traffic it exchanges with
them. By creating its own network, a contentprovider not only reduces
its payments to upper-tier ISPs, but also has greater control of how
its services are ultimately delivered to end users.

A packet can be transmitted on a link only if there is no other packet
currently being transmitted on the link and if there are no other packets

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<p>
Let’s now consider the total delay from source to destination. To get a
handle on this concept, suppose there are N−1 routers between the source
host and the destination host. Let’s also suppose for the moment that the
network is uncongested (so that queuing delays are negligible), the
processing delay at each router and at the source host is d proc , the
transmission rate out of each router and out of the source host is R
bits/sec, and the propagation on each link is d prop . The nodal delays
accumulate and give an end-to- end delay,

<h3 id="org4c4853e"><span class="section-number-3">4.4</span> Throughput</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-4">
<p>
To define throughput, consider transferring a large file from Host A to Host
B across a computer network. This transfer might be, for example, a large
video clip from one peer to another in a P2P file sharing system.
</p>

<p>
The <code>instantaneous throughput</code> at any instant of time is the rate (in
bits/sec) at which a Host is receiving a file.
</p>

<p>
If the file consists of F bits and the transfer takes T seconds for a Host to
receive all F bits, then the <code>average throughput</code> of the file transfer is F/T
bits/sec.
</p>

<p>
imagen 1.19
</p>

<p>
Figure 1.19(a) shows two end systems, a server and a client, connected by
two communication links and a router.
</p>

<p>
Consider the throughput for a file transfer from the server to the client.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Let \(R_{s}\) denote the rate of the link between the server and the router</li>
<li>Let \(R_{c}\) denote the rate of the link between the router and the client</li>
</ul>

<p>
Suppose that the only bits being sent in the entire network are those from
the server to the client.  We now ask, in this ideal scenario, what is the
server-to-client throughput?
</p>

<p>
the server cannot pump bits through its link at a rate faster than
\(R_{s}\) bps; and the router cannot forward bits at a rate faster than
\(R_{c}\) bps.
</p>

<p>
If \(R_{s}\)&lt;\(R_{c}\), then the bits pumped by the server will “flow” right
through the router and arrive at the client at a rate of \(R_{s}\) bps, giving
a throughput of \(R_{s}\) bps.
</p>

<p>
If \(R_{c}\)&lt;\(R_{s}\), then the router will not be able to forward bits as
quickly as it receives them. In this case, bits will only leave the router at
rate \(R_{c}\) , giving an end-to-end throughput of \(R_{c}\) .
</p>

<p>
For this simple two-link network, the throughput is \(min\{R_{c}, R_{s} \}\),
that is, it is the transmission rate of the <code>bottleneck link</code>.
</p>

<p>
Figure 1.19(b) now shows a network with N links between the server and the
client, with the transmission rates of the N links being R1,R2,&#x2026;,
RN. Applying the same analysis as for the two-link network, we find that the
throughput for a file transfer from server to client is \(min \{R1,R2,...,
   RN\}\) , which is once again the transmission rate of the bottleneck link
along the path between server and client.
</p>

<p>
imagen 1.20
</p>

<p>
the constraining factor for throughput in today’s Internet is typically the
access network.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
when there is no other intervening traffic, the throughput can simply be
approximated as the minimum transmission rate along the path between source
and destination.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
The example in Figure 1.20(b) shows that more generally the throughput
depends not only on the transmission rates of the links along the path, but
also on the intervening traffic.
</p>

<p>
In particular, a link with a high transmission rate may nonetheless be the
bottleneck link for a file transfer if many other data flows are also
passing through that link.

<p>
When taken together, the protocols of the various layers are called the
<code>protocol stack</code>. The Internet protocol stack consists of five layers: the
physical, link, network, transport, and application layers
</p>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org668d670" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org668d670"><span class="section-number-5">5.1.1.1</span> Application Layer</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-5-1-1-1">
<p>
The application layer is where network applications and their
application-layer protocols reside.
</p>

<p>
The Internet’s application layer includes many protocols, such as the
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>HTTP protocol (which provides for Web document request and transfer),</li>
<li>SMTP (which provides for the transfer of e-mail messages), and</li>
<li>FTP (which provides for the transfer of files between two end systems).</li>
<li>DNS (which translates human-friendly names for Internet end systems like
www.ietf.org to a 32-bit network address)</li>
</ul>

<p>
An application-layer protocol is distributed over multiple end systems,
with the application in one end system using the protocol to exchange
packets of information with the application in another end system. We’ll
refer to this packet of information at the application layer as a
<code>message</code>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3e44bbc" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org3e44bbc"><span class="section-number-5">5.1.1.2</span> Transport Layer</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-5-1-1-2">
<p>
The Internet’s transport layer transports application-layer messages
between application endpoints. In the Internet there are two transport
protocols, TCP and UDP, either of which can transport application- layer
messages.
</p>

<p>
TCP provides a ­ connection-oriented service to its applications. This
service includes guaranteed delivery of application-layer messages to the
destination and flow control (that is, sender/receiver speed matching). TCP
also breaks long messages into shorter ­ segments and provides a
congestion-control mechanism, so that a source throttles its transmission
rate when the network is congested.
</p>

<p>
The UDP protocol provides a connectionless service to its
applications. This is a no-frills service that provides no reliability, no
flow control, and no congestion control. In this book, we’ll refer to a
transport-layer packet as a <code>segment</code>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf24eb3c" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="orgf24eb3c"><span class="section-number-5">5.1.1.3</span> Network Layer</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-5-1-1-3">
<p>
The network layer is responsible for moving network-layer packets known as
<code>datagrams</code> from one host to another. The Internet transport-layer protocol
(TCP or UDP) in a source host passes a transport-layer segment and a
destination address to the network layer, just as you would give the postal
service a letter with a destination address. The network layer then
provides the service of delivering the segment to the transport layer in
the destination host.
</p>

<p>
The Internet’s network layer includes the celebrated IP protocol, which
defines the fields in the datagram as well as how the end systems and
routers act on these fields. There is only one IP protocol, and all
Internet components that have a network layer must run the IP
protocol. The Internet’s network layer also contains routing protocols
that determine the routes that datagrams take between sources and
destinations.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1740412" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org1740412"><span class="section-number-5">5.1.1.4</span> Link Layer</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-5-1-1-4">
<p>
delivers the datagram to the next node along the route.
</p>

<p>
The services provided by the link layer depend on the specific link-layer
protocol that is employed over the link. For example, some link-layer
protocols provide reliable delivery, from transmitting node, over one
link, to receiving node. Note that this reliable delivery service is
different from the reliable delivery service of TCP, which provides
reliable delivery from one end system to another.
</p>

<p>
Examples of link-layer protocols include Ethernet, WiFi, and the cable
access network’s DOCSIS protocol.
</p>

<p>
As datagrams typically need to traverse several links to travel from
source to destination, a datagram may be handled by different link-layer
protocols at different links along its route.
</p>

<p>
link-layer packets are refered as <code>frames</code>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgfc4cc67" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="orgfc4cc67"><span class="section-number-5">5.1.1.5</span> Physical Layer</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-5-1-1-5">
<p>
While the job of the link layer is to move entire frames from one network
element to an adjacent network element, the job of the physical layer is
to move the individual bits within the frame from one node to the next.
</p>

<p>
The protocols in this layer are again link dependent and further depend on
the actual transmission medium of the link (for example, twisted-pair
copper wire, single-mode fiber optics).
</p>

<p>
For example, Ethernet has many physical-layer protocols: one for
twisted-pair copper wire, another for coaxial cable, another for fiber,
and so on. In each case, a bit is moved across the link in a different
way.

<p>
tiene 7 capas.
</p>

<p>
The functionality of five of these layers is roughly the same as their
similarly named Internet counterparts.
</p>

<p>
The role of the presentation layer is to provide services that allow
communicating applications to interpret the meaning of data
exchanged. These services include data compression and data encryption as
well as data description (which frees the applications from having to worry
about the internal format in which data are represented/stored-formats that
may differ from one computer to another).
</p>

<p>
The session layer provides for delimiting and synchronization of data
exchange, including the means to build a checkpointing and recovery scheme.
</p>

<p>
In the Internet model, these services are delegated to the Application
Layer.

<p>
Figure 1.24 shows the physical path that data takes down a sending end
system’s protocol stack, up and down the protocol stacks of an intervening
link-layer switch and router, and then up the protocol stack at the receiving
end system.
</p>

<p>
imagen 1.24
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>link-layer switches implement layers 1 and 2;</li>
<li>routers implement layers 1 through 3.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Internet routers are capable of implementing the IP protocol (a layer 3
protocol), while link-layer switches are not.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Note that hosts implement all five layers; this is consistent with the view
that the Internet architecture puts much of its complexity at the edges of
the network.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
Figure 1.24 also illustrates the important concept of <code>encapsulation</code>. At the
sending host, an <code>application-layer message</code> is passed to the transport
layer. In the simplest case, the transport layer takes the message and
appends additional information that will be used by the receiver-side
transport layer. The application-layer message and the transport-layer header
information together constitute the <code>transport-layer segment</code>. The
transport-layer segment thus encapsulates the application-layer message.
</p>

<p>
The added information might include information allowing the receiver-side
transport layer to deliver the message up to the appropriate application, and
error-detection bits that allow the receiver to determine whether bits in the
message have been changed in route.
</p>

<p>
The transport layer then passes the segment to the network layer, which adds
network-layer header information such as source and destination end system
addresses, creating a <code>network-layer datagram</code>.
</p>

<p>
The datagram is then passed to the link layer, which will add its own
link-layer header information and create a <code>link-layer frame</code>.
</p>

<p>
at each layer, a packet has two types of fields: header fields and a <code>payload
   field</code>. The payload is typically a packet from the layer above.
</p>

<p>
The process of encapsulation can be more complex than that described
above. For example, a large message may be divided into multiple
transport-layer segments (which might themselves each be divided into
multiple network-layer datagrams). At the receiving end, such a segment must
then be reconstructed from its constituent datagrams.

<h2 id="org6d0bc80"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> Networks Under Attack</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
Viruses are malware that require some form of user interaction to infect the
user’s device. The classic example is an e-mail attachment containing
malicious executable code. If a user receives and opens such an attachment,
the user inadvertently runs the malware on the device.  Typically, such e-mail
viruses are self-replicating: once executed, the virus may send an identical
message with an identical malicious attachment to, for example, every
recipient in the user’s address book.
</p>

<p>
Worms are malware that can enter a device without any explicit user
interaction. For example, a user may be running a vulnerable network
application to which an attacker can send malware. In some cases, without any
user intervention, the application may accept the malware from the Internet
and run it, creating a worm. The worm in the newly infected device then scans
the Internet, searching for other hosts running the same vulnerable network
application. When it finds other vulnerable hosts, it sends a copy of itself
to those hosts.
</p>

<p>
Another broad class of security threats are known as <code>denial-of-service (DoS)</code>
attacks. As the name suggests, a DoS attack renders a network, host, or other
piece of infrastructure unusable by legitimate users. Web servers, e-mail
servers, DNS servers, and institutional networks can all be subject to DoS
attacks. Internet DoS attacks are extremely common, with thousands of DoS
ttacks occurring every year.
</p>

<p>
Most Internet DoS attacks fall into one of three categories:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Vulnerability attack</dt><dd>This involves sending a few well-crafted messages to
a vulnerable application or operating system running on a targeted host. If
the right sequence of packets is sent to a vulnerable application or
operating system, the service can stop or, worse, the host can crash.</dd>
<dt>Bandwidth flooding</dt><dd>The attacker sends a deluge of packets to the targeted
host-so many packets that the target’s access link becomes clogged,
preventing legitimate packets from reaching the server.</dd>
<dt>Connection flooding</dt><dd>The attacker establishes a large number of half-open
or fully open TCP connections (TCP connections are discussed in Chapter 3)
at the target host. The host can become so bogged down with these bogus
connections that it stops accepting legitimate connections.</dd>
