<p>
the network layer can be decomposed into two interacting parts, the <code>data plane</code>
and the <code>control plane</code>.
</p>

<p>
the data plane functions of the network layer—the per-router functions in the
network layer that determine how a datagram (that is, a network-layer packet)
arriving on one of a router’s input links is forwarded to one of that router’s
output links.
</p>

<p>
the control plane functions of the network layer—the network-wide logic that
controls how a datagram is routed among routers along an end-to-end path from
the source host to the destination host.
</p>

<p>
Traditionally, these control-plane routing protocols and data-plane forwarding
functions have been implemented together, monolithically, within a router.
</p>

<p>
As we will see later, Software-defined networking (SDN) explicitly separates the
data plane and control plane by implementing these control plane functions as a
separate service, typically in a remote “controller”.
</p>

<p>
This distinction between data-plane and control-plane functions in the network
layer is an important concept to keep in mind as you learn about the network
layer —it will help structure your thinking about the network layer and reflects
a modern view of the network layer’s role in computer networking.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgbe0ab24" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgbe0ab24">Overview of the Network Layer</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbe0ab24">
<p>
Figure 4.1 shows a simple network with two hosts, H1 and H2, and several routers
on the path between H1 and H2. Let’s suppose that H1 is sending information to
H2, and consider the role of the network layer in these hosts and in the
intervening routers. The network layer in H1 takes segments from the transport
layer in H1, encapsulates each segment into a datagram, and then sends the
datagrams to its nearby router, R1. At the receiving host, H2, the network layer
receives the datagrams from its nearby router R2, extracts the transport-layer
segments, and delivers the segments up to the transport layer at H2.
</p>

<p>
The primary data-plane role of each router is to forward datagrams from its
input links to its output links; the primary role of the control plane is to
coordinate these local, per-router forwarding actions so that datagrams are
ultimately transferred end-to-end, along paths of routers between source and
destination hosts.
</p>

<p>
Note that the routers in Figure 4.1 are shown with a truncated protocol stack,
that is, with no upper layers above the network layer, because routers do not
run application- and transport-layer protocols

<h3 id="org611fde4">Forwarding and Routing: The Data and Control Planes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org611fde4">
<p>
The primary role of the network layer is deceptively simple—to move packets from
a sending host to a receiving host.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org94b2148" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org94b2148">Forwarding</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org94b2148">
<p>
When a packet arrives at a router’s input link, the router must move the packet
to the appropriate output link. For example, a packet arriving from Host H1 to
Router R1 in Figure 4.1 must be forwarded to the next router on a path to H2. As
we will see, forwarding is but one function implemented in the data plane. In
the more general case, a packet might also be blocked from exiting a router
(e.g., if the packet originated at a known malicious sending host, or if the
packet were destined to a forbidden destination host), or might be duplicated
and sent over multiple outgoing links.
</p>

<p>
Forwarding refers to the router-local action of transferring a packet from an
input link interface to the appropriate output link interface. Forwarding takes
place at very short timescales (typically a few nanoseconds), and thus is
typically implemented in hardware.
</p>

<p>
A key element in every network router is its <code>forwarding table</code>. A router
forwards a packet by examining the value of one or more fields in the arriving
packet’s header, and then using these header values to index into its forwarding
table. The value stored in the forwarding table entry for those values indicates
the outgoing link interface at that router to which that packet is to be
forwarded.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf5c352d" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf5c352d">Routing</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf5c352d">
<p>
The network layer must determine the route or path taken by packets as they flow
from a sender to a receiver. The algorithms that calculate these paths are
referred to as routing algorithms. A routing algorithm would determine, for
example, the path along which packets flow from H1 to H2 in Figure 4.1. Routing
is implemented in the control plane of the network layer.
</p>

<p>
Routing refers to the network-wide process that determines the end-to-end paths
that packets take from source to destination. Routing takes place on much longer
timescales (typically seconds), and as we will see is often implemented in
software.

how a router’s forwarding tables are configured in the first place?
</p>

<p>
the routing algorithm determines the contents of the routers’ forwarding tables.
</p>

<p>
a routing algorithm runs in each and every router, and both forwarding and
routing functions are contained within a router.
</p>

<p>
the routing algorithm function in one router communicates with the routing
algorithm function in other routers to compute the values for its forwarding
table. How is this communication performed? By exchanging routing messages
containing routing information according to a routing protocol.

Figure 4.3 shows an alternate approach in which a physically separate (from the
routers), remote controller computes and distributes the forwarding tables to be
used by each and every router.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
control-plane routing functionality is separated from the physical router. the
routing device performs forwarding only, while the remote controller computes
and distributes forwarding tables. The remote controller might be implemented in
a remote data center with high reliability and redundancy, and might be managed
by the ISP or some third party. How might the routers and the remote controller
communicate? By exchanging messages containing forwarding tables and other
pieces of routing information.

<h3 id="org23976b6">Network Service Model</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org23976b6">
<p>
The <code>network service model</code> defines the characteristics of end-to-end delivery
of packets between sending and receiving hosts.
</p>

<p>
Let’s now consider some possible services that the network layer could provide. 
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Guaranteed delivery</dt><dd>This service guarantees that a packet sent by a source
host will eventually arrive at the destination host.</dd>
<dt>Guaranteed delivery with bounded delay</dt><dd>This service not only guarantees
delivery of the packet, but delivery within a specified host-to-host delay
bound (for example, within 100 msec).</dd>
<dt>In-order packet delivery</dt><dd>This service guarantees that packets arrive at the
destination in the order that they were sent.</dd>
<dt>Guaranteed minimal bandwidth</dt><dd>This network-layer service emulates the
behavior of a transmission link of a specified bit rate (for example, 1 Mbps)
between sending and receiving hosts. As long as the sending host transmits
bits (as part of packets) at a rate below the specified bit rate, then all
packets are eventually delivered to the destination host.</dd>
<dt>Security</dt><dd>The network layer could encrypt all datagrams at the source and
decrypt them at the destination, thereby providing confidentiality to all
transport-layer segments.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The Internet’s network layer provides a single service, known as <code>best-effort
service</code>. With best-effort service, packets are neither guaranteed to be
received in the order in which they were sent, nor is their eventual delivery
even guaranteed. There is no guarantee on the end-to-end delay nor is there a
minimal bandwidth guarantee.

<h2 id="org25805eb">Qué hay adentro de un router?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org25805eb">
<p>
imagen 4.4
</p>

<p>
A high-level view of a generic router architecture is shown in Figure 4.4. Four router components can be identified:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Input ports</dt><dd>An input port performs several key functions. It performs the
physical layer function of terminating an incoming physical link at a router;
this is shown in the leftmost box of an input port and the rightmost box of an
output port in Figure 4.4. An input port also performs link-layer functions
needed to interoperate with the link layer at the other side of the incoming
link; this is represented by the middle boxes in the input and output ports.
Perhaps most crucially, a lookup function is also performed at the input port;
this will occur in the rightmost box of the input port. It is here that the
forwarding table is consulted to determine the router output port to which an
arriving packet will be forwarded via the switching fabric. Control packets
(for example, packets carrying routing protocol information) are forwarded
from an input port to the routing processor.</dd>
<dt>Switching fabric</dt><dd>The switching fabric connects the router’s input ports to
its output ports. This switching fabric is completely contained within the
router—a network inside of a network router!</dd>
<dt>Output ports</dt><dd>An output port stores packets received from the switching
fabric and transmits these packets on the outgoing link by performing the
necessary link-layer and physical-layer functions. When a link is
bidirectional (that is, carries traffic in both directions), an output port
will typically be paired with the input port for that link on the same line
card.</dd>
<dt>Routing processor</dt><dd>The routing processor performs control-plane functions.
In traditional routers, it executes the routing protocols, maintains routing
tables and attached link state information, and computes the forwarding table
for the router. In SDN routers, the routing processor is responsible for
communicating with the remote controller in order to (among other activities)
receive forwarding table entries computed by the remote controller, and
install these entries in the router’s input ports. The routing processor also
performs the network management functions.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
A router’s input ports, output ports, and switching fabric are almost always
implemented in hardware because its faster than a software implementation.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf76c112" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf76c112">Input Port Processing and Destination-Based Forwarding</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf76c112">
<p>
A more detailed view of input processing is shown in Figure 4.5. 
</p>

<p>
imagen 4.5
</p>

<p>
The lookup performed in the input port is central to the router’s operation—it
is here that the router uses the forwarding table to look up the output port to
which an arriving packet will be forwarded via the switching fabric.
</p>

<p>
The forwarding table is copied from the routing processor to the line cards over
a separate bus. With such a shadow copy at each line card, forwarding decisions
can be made locally, at each input port, without invoking the centralized
routing processor on a per-packet basis and thus avoiding a centralized
processing bottleneck.
</p>

<p>
Consider the case that the output port to which an incoming packet is to be
switched is based on the packet’s destination address. As an example of how this
issue of scale can be handled, let’s suppose that our router has four links,
numbered 0 through 3, and that packets are to be forwarded to the link
interfaces as follows:

<p>
With this style of forwarding table, the router matches a <code>prefix</code> of the
packet’s destination address with the entries in the table; if there’s a match,
the router forwards the packet to a link associated with the match.
</p>

<p>
When there are multiple matches, the router uses the <code>longest prefix matching
rule</code>; that is, it finds the longest matching entry in the table and forwards
the packet to the link interface associated with the longest prefix match.
</p>

<p>
Once a packet’s output port has been determined via the lookup, the packet can
be sent into the switching fabric. In some designs, a packet may be temporarily
blocked from entering the switching fabric if packets from other input ports are
currently using the fabric. A blocked packet will be queued at the input port
and then scheduled to cross the fabric at a later point in time.

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Switching via memory</dt><dd>The earliest routers were traditional computers, with
switching between input and output ports being done under direct control of
the CPU. Input and output ports functioned as traditional I/O devices in an
operating system. An input port with an arriving packet first signaled the CPU
via an interrupt. The packet was then copied from the input port into memory.
The CPU then extracted the destination address from the header, looked up the
appropriate output port in the forwarding table, and copied the packet to the
output port’s buffers. In this scenario, if the memory bandwidth is such that
a maximum of B packets per second can be written into, or read from, memory,
then the overall forwarding throughput (the total rate at which packets are
transfered from input ports to output ports) must be less than B/2. Note that
two packets cannot be forwarded at the same time, even if they have different
destination ports, since only one memory read/write can be done at a time over
the shared system bus.</dd>
<dt>Switching via a bus</dt><dd>an input port transfers a packet directly to the output
port over a shared bus, without intervention by the CPU. This is typically
done by having the input port pre-pend a switch-internal label (header) to the
packet indicating the local output port to which this packet is being
transferred and transmitting the packet onto the bus. All output ports receive
the packet, but only the port that matches the label will keep the packet. The
label is then removed at the output port. If multiple packets arrive to the
router at the same time, each at a different input port, all but one must wait
since only one packet can cross the bus at a time. the switching speed of the
router is limited to the bus speed. Nonetheless, switching via a bus is often
sufficient for routers that operate in small local area and enterprise
networks.</dd>
<dt>Switching via an interconnection network</dt><dd>One way to overcome the bandwidth
limitation of a single, shared bus is to use a more sophisticated
interconnection network. A crossbar switch is an interconnection network
consisting of 2N buses that connect N input ports to N output ports. Each
vertical bus intersects each horizontal bus at a crosspoint, which can be
opened or closed at any time by the switch fabric controller (whose logic is
part of the switching fabric itself). When a packet arrives from port A and
needs to be forwarded to port Y, the switch controller closes the crosspoint
at the intersection of busses A and Y, and port A then sends the packet onto
its bus, which is picked up (only) by bus Y. Note that a packet from port B
can be forwarded to port X at the same time, since the A-to-Y and B-to-X
packets use different input and output busses. Thus, unlike the previous two
switching approaches, crossbar switches are capable of forwarding multiple
packets in parallel. A crossbar switch is non-blocking—a packet being
forwarded to an output port will not be blocked from reaching that output port
as long as no other packet is currently being forwarded to that output port.
However, if two packets from two different input ports are destined to that
same output port, then one will have to wait at the input,</dd>
</dl>
<p>
since only one packet can be sent over any given bus at a time.
</p>

<p>

<p>
More sophisticated interconnection networks use multiple stages of switching
elements to allow packets from different input ports to proceed towards the same
output port at the same time through the multi-stage switching fabric. A
router’s switching capacity can also be scaled by running multiple switching
fabrics in parallel. In this approach, where input ports and output ports are
connected to N switching fabrics that operate in parallel.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4170c61">

Output port processing, takes packets that have been stored in the output port’s
memory and transmits them over the output link. This includes selecting and
de-queueing packets for transmission, and performing the needed link-layer and
physical-layer transmission functions.

packet queues may form at both the input ports and the output ports. The
location and extent of queueing (either at the input port queues or the output
port queues) will depend on the traffic load, the relative speed of the
switching fabric, and the line speed.
</p>

<p>
since these queues grow large, the router’s memory can eventually be exhausted
and packet loss will occur when no memory is available to store arriving
packets.

<code>head-of-the-line (HOL) blocking</code> in an input-queued switch—a queued packet in
an input queue must wait for transfer through the fabric (even though its output
port is free) because it is blocked by another packet at the head of the line.

When there is not enough memory to buffer an incoming packet, a decision must be
made to either drop the arriving packet (a policy known as <code>drop-tail</code>) or
remove one or more already-queued packets to make room for the newly arrived
packet. In some cases, it may be advantageous to drop (or mark the header of) a
packet before the buffer is full in order to provide a congestion signal to the
sender. A number of proactive packet dropping-and-marking policies (collectively
known as <code>active queue management (AQM)</code> algorithms) have been proposed and
analyzed.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb40328d">
<p>
packets arriving at the output link are classified into priority classes upon
arrival at the queue. In practice, a network operator may configure a queue so
that packets carrying network management information (e.g., as indicated by the
source or destination TCP/UDP port number) receive priority over user traffic.
</p>

<p>

<p>
Each priority class typically has its own queue. When choosing a packet to
transmit, the priority queuing discipline will transmit a packet from the
highest priority class that has a nonempty queue (that is, has packets waiting
for transmission). The choice among packets in the same priority class is
typically done in a FIFO manner.

<h4 id="orgd5a711b">Round Robin and Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd5a711b">
<p>
In Round Robin discipline, packets are sorted into classes as with priority
queuing. However, rather than there being a strict service priority among
classes, a round robin scheduler alternates service among the classes.
</p>

<p>
A <code>work-conserving queuing</code> discipline will never allow the link to remain idle
whenever there are packets (of any class) queued for transmission. A
work-conserving round robin discipline that looks for a packet of a given class
but finds none will immediately check the next class in the round robin
sequence.
</p>

<p>
imagen 4.14
</p>

<p>
In another RR discpline called <code>weighted fair queuing (WFQ)</code>, arriving packets
are classified and queued in the appropriate per-class waiting area. As in round
robin scheduling, a WFQ scheduler will serve classes in a circular manner— first
serving class 1, then serving class 2, then serving class 3, and then (assuming
there are three classes) repeating the service pattern. WFQ is also a
work-conserving discpline and thus will immediately move on to the next class in
the service sequence when it finds an empty class queue.
</p>

<p>
WFQ differs from round robin in that each class may receive a differential
amount of service in any interval of time. Specifically, each class, i, is
assigned a weight, \(w_{i}\). Under WFQ, during any interval of time during which
there are class i packets to send, class i will then be guaranteed to receive a
fraction of service equal to (\(w_{i}/\sum_{j}w_{j}\)) where the sum in the
denominator is taken over all classes that also have packets queued for
transmission. In the worst case, even if all classes have queued packets, class
i will still be guaranteed to receive a fraction of the bandwidth, where in this
worst case the sum in the denominator is over all classes. For a link with
transmission rate R, class i will always achieve a throughput of at least
\(R*w_{i}/\sum_{j}w_{j}\).
