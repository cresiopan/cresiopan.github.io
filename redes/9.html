<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
A host typically has only a single link into the network; when IP in the host
wants to send a datagram, it does so over this link. The boundary between the
host and the physical link is called an <code>interface</code>.
</p>

<p>
Now consider a router and its interfaces. Because a router’s job is to receive a
datagram on one link and forward the datagram on some other link, a router
necessarily has two or more links to which it is connected. The boundary between
the router and any one of its links is also called an interface. A router thus
has multiple interfaces, one for each of its links.
</p>

<p>
Because every host and router is capable of sending and receiving IP datagrams,
IP requires each host and router interface to have its own IP address. Thus, an
IP address is technically associated with an interface, rather than with the
host or router containing that interface.
</p>

<p>
Each IP address is 32 bits long (4 bytes), and there are thus a total of
\(2^{32}\) (or approximately 4 billion) possible IP addresses.
</p>

<p>
Each interface on every host and router in the global Internet must have an IP
address that is globally unique. These addresses cannot be chosen in a
willy-nilly manner, however. A portion of an interface’s IP address will be
determined by the subnet to which it is connected.
</p>

<p>
&#x2014; A group of interfaces interconnected to each other by a network that
contains no routers forms a <code>subnet</code>. [RFC 950] Interfaces in the same subnet
share a number of bits in their IP address. This is called <code>subnet mask</code>, which
are the (N) leftmost bits of the address. It is &#x2014;
</p>

<p>
imagen 4.18
</p>


<p>
imagen 4.19
</p>

<p>
For a general interconnected system of routers and hosts, we can use the
following recipe to define the subnets in the system:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
To determine the subnets, detach each interface from its host or router,
creating islands of isolated networks, with interfaces terminating the end
points of the isolated networks. Each of these isolated networks is called a
subnet.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
imagen 4.20
</p>

<p>
The Internet’s address assignment strategy is known as <code>Classless Interdomain
Routing (CIDR)</code> [RFC 4632]. CIDR generalizes the notion of subnet addressing. As
with subnet addressing, the 32-bit IP address is divided into two parts and
again has the dotted-decimal form a.b.c.d/x, where x indicates the number of
bits in the first part of the address.
</p>

<p>
The x most significant bits of an address of the form a.b.c.d/x constitute the
network portion of the IP address, and are often referred to as the <code>prefix</code> (or
network prefix) of the address. An organization is typically assigned a block of
contiguous addresses, that is, a range of addresses with a common prefix.
</p>

<p>
The remaining \(32-x\) bits of an address can be thought of as distinguishing
among the devices within the organization, all of which have the same network
prefix. These are the bits that will be considered when forwarding packets at
routers within the organization. These lower-order bits may (or may not) have an
additional subnetting structure, such as that discussed above.
</p>

<p>
Before CIDR was adopted, the network portions of an IP address were constrained
to be 8, 16, or 24 bits in length, an addressing scheme known as <code>classful
addressing</code>, since subnets with 8-, 16-, and 24-bit subnet addresses were known
as class A, B, and C networks, respectively.
</p>


<p>
The IP broadcast address 255.255.255.255. When a host sends a datagram with
destination address 255.255.255.255, the message is delivered to all hosts on
the same subnet. Routers optionally forward the message into neighboring subnets
as well (although they usually don’t).

In order to obtain a block of IP addresses for use within an organization’s
subnet, a network administrator might first contact its ISP, which would provide
addresses from a larger block of addresses that had already been allocated to
the ISP.

<p>
Is there a global authority that has ultimate responsibility for managing the IP
address space and allocating address blocks to ISPs and other organizations?
</p>

<p>
Indeed there is! IP addresses are managed under the authority of the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) [ICANN 2016], based on
guidelines set forth in [RFC 7020].
</p>

<h3 id="org002509b"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Obtaining a Host Address: The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
Once an organization has obtained a block of addresses, it can assign individual
IP addresses to the host and router interfaces in its organization. A system
administrator will typically manually configure the IP addresses into the
router. Host addresses can also be configured manually, but typically this is
done using the <code>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)</code> [RFC 2131]. DHCP
allows a host to obtain (be allocated) an IP address automatically.
</p>

<p>
A network administrator can configure DHCP so that a given host receives the
same IP address each time it connects to the network, or a host may be assigned
a <code>temporary IP address</code> that will be different each time the host connects to
the network. In addition to host IP address assignment, DHCP also allows a host
to learn additional information, such as its subnet mask, the address of its
first-hop router (often called the default gateway), and the address of its
local DNS server.
</p>

<p>
DHCP is a client-server protocol. A client is typically a newly arriving host
wanting to obtain network configuration information, including an IP address for
itself. In the simplest case, each subnet will have a DHCP server. If no server
is present on the subnet, a DHCP relay agent (typically a router) that knows the
address of a DHCP server for that network is needed.
</p>

<p>
Figure 4.23 shows a DHCP server attached to subnet 223.1.2/24, with the router
serving as the relay agent for arriving clients attached to subnets 223.1.1/24
and 223.1.3/24.
</p>

<p>
imagen 4.23
</p>

<p>
For a newly arriving host, the DHCP protocol is a four-step process for the
network setting shown in Figure 4.23:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>DHCP server discovery. The first task of a newly arriving host is to find a
DHCP server with which to interact. This is done using a DHCP discover
message, which a client sends within a UDP packet to port 67. The UDP packet
is encapsulated in an IP datagram. the IP datagram contains a DHCP discover
message along with the broadcast destination IP address of 255.255.255.255
and a “this host” source IP address of 0.0.0.0. The DHCP client passes the IP
datagram to the link layer, which then broadcasts this frame to all nodes
attached to the subnet.</li>
<li>DHCP server offer(s). A DHCP server receiving a DHCP discover message
responds to the client with a DHCP offer message that is broadcast to all
nodes on the subnet, again using the IP broadcast address of 255.255.255.255.
Since several DHCP servers can be present on the subnet, the client may find
itself in the enviable position of being able to choose from among several
offers. Each server offer message contains the transaction ID of the received
discover message, the proposed IP address for the client, the network mask,
and an IP address lease time—the amount of time for which the IP address will
be valid. It is common for the server to set the lease time to several hours
or days.</li>
<li>DHCP request. The newly arriving client will choose from among one or more
server offers and respond to its selected offer with a DHCP request message,
echoing back the configuration parameters.</li>
<li>DHCP ACK. The server responds to the DHCP request message with a DHCP ACK
message, confirming the requested parameters.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Once the client receives the DHCP ACK, the interaction is complete and the
client can use the DHCP-allocated IP address for the lease duration. Since a
client may want to use its address beyond the lease’s expiration, DHCP also
provides a mechanism that allows a client to renew its lease on an IP address.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
[RFC 2663; RFC 3022]
</p>

<p>
Figure 4.25 shows the operation of a NAT-enabled router. The NAT-enabled router,
residing in the home, has an interface that is part of the home network on the
right of Figure 4.25. Addressing within the home network is exactly as we have
seen above—all four interfaces in the home network have the same subnet address
of 10.0.0/24. The address space 10.0.0.0/8 is one of three portions of the IP
address space that is reserved in <code>[RFC 1918]</code> for a <code>private network</code> or a
<code>realm with private addresses</code>, such as the home network in Figure 4.25. A realm
with private addresses refers to a network whose addresses only have meaning to
devices within that network. To see why this is important, consider the fact
that there are hundreds of thousands of home networks, many using the same
address space, 10.0.0.0/24. Devices within a given home network can send packets
to each other using 10.0.0.0/24 addressing. However, packets forwarded beyond
the home network into the larger global Internet clearly cannot use these
addresses (as either a source or a destination address) because there are
hundreds of thousands of networks using this block of addresses. That is, the
10.0.0.0/24 addresses can only have meaning within the given home network. But
if private addresses only have meaning within a given network, how is addressing
handled when packets are sent to or received from the global Internet, where
addresses are necessarily unique?
</p>

<p>
The NAT-enabled router does not look like a router to the outside world. Instead
the NAT router behaves to the outside world as a single device with a single IP
address. In Figure 4.25, all traffic leaving the home router for the larger
Internet has a source IP address of 138.76.29.7, and all traffic entering the
home router must have a destination address of 138.76.29.7. In essence, the
NAT-enabled router is hiding the details of the home network from the outside
world.
</p>

<p>
A <code>NAT translation table</code> is used at the NAT-enabled router to know which
internal host it should forward a datagram. The table includes port numbers and
IP addresses.

<dt>Expanded addressing capabilities</dt><dd>IPv6 increases the size of the IP address
from 32 to 128 bits. This ensures that the world won’t run out of IP
addresses. In addition to unicast and multicast addresses, IPv6 has introduced
a new type of address, called an anycast address, that allows a datagram to be
delivered to any one of a group of hosts. (This feature could be used, for
example, to send an HTTP GET to the nearest of a number of mirror sites that
contain a given document.)</dd>
<dt>A streamlined 40-byte header</dt><dd>As discussed below, a number of IPv4 fields
have been dropped or made optional. The resulting 40-byte fixed-length header
allows for faster processing of the IP datagram by a router. A new encoding of
options allows for more flexible options processing.</dd>
<dt>Flow labeling</dt><dd>IPv6 has an elusive definition of a flow. RFC 2460 states
that this allows “labeling of packets belonging to particular flows for which
the sender requests special handling, such as a non-default quality of service
or real-time service.” For example, audio and video transmission might likely
be treated as a flow. On the other hand, the more traditional applications,
such as file transfer and e-mail, might not be treated as flows. It is
possible that the traffic carried by a high-priority user (for example,
someone paying for better service for their traffic) might also be treated as
a flow. What is clear, however, is that the designers of IPv6 foresaw the
eventual need to be able to differentiate among the flows, even if the exact
meaning of a flow had yet to be determined.</dd>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Fragmentation/reassembly IPv6 does not allow for fragmentation and reassembly
at intermediate routers; these operations can be performed only by the source
and destination. If an IPv6 datagram received by a router is too large to be
forwarded over the outgoing link, the router simply drops the datagram and
sends a “Packet Too Big” ICMP error message back to the sender. The sender can
then resend the data, using a smaller IP datagram size. Fragmentation and
reassembly is a time-consuming operation; removing this functionality from the
routers and placing it squarely in the end systems considerably speeds up IP
forwarding within the network.</li>
<li>Header checksum Because the transport-layer (for example, TCP and UDP) and
link-layer (for example, Ethernet) protocols in the Internet layers perform
checksumming, the designers of IP probably felt that this functionality was
sufficiently redundant in the network layer that it could be removed. Once
again, fast processing of IP packets was a central concern. Recall that the
header checksum needed to be recomputed at every router. As with fragmentation
and reassembly, this too was a costly operation in IPv4.</li>
<li>Options An options field is no longer a part of the standard IP header.
However, it has not gone away. Instead, the options field is one of the
possible next headers pointed to from within the IPv6 header. That is, just as
TCP or UDP protocol headers can be the next header within an IP packet, so too
can an options field. The removal of the options field results in a
fixed-length, 40-byte IP header.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
imagen 4.27
</p>

<p>
The approach to IPv4-to-IPv6 transition that has been most widely adopted in
practice involves <code>tunneling [RFC 4213]</code>.
</p>

<p>
Suppose two IPv6 nodes (in this example, B and E in Figure 4.27) want to
interoperate using IPv6 datagrams but are connected to each other by intervening
IPv4 routers.
</p>

<p>
We refer to the intervening set of IPv4 routers between two IPv6 routers as a
<code>tunnel</code>, as illustrated in Figure 4.27. With tunneling, the IPv6 node on the
sending side of the tunnel (in this example, B) takes the entire IPv6 datagram
and puts it in the data (payload) field of an IPv4 datagram. This IPv4 datagram
is then addressed to the IPv6 node on the receiving side of the tunnel (in this
example, E) and sent to the first node in the tunnel (in this example, C).
</p>

<p>
The intervening IPv4 routers in the tunnel route this IPv4 datagram among
themselves, just as they would any other datagram, blissfully unaware that the
IPv4 datagram itself contains a complete IPv6 datagram. The IPv6 node on the
receiving side of the tunnel eventually receives the IPv4 datagram (it is the
destination of the IPv4 datagram!), determines that the IPv4 datagram contains
an IPv6 datagram (by observing that the protocol number field in the IPv4
datagram is 41 <code>[RFC 4213]</code>, indicating that the IPv4 payload is a IPv6
datagram), extracts the IPv6 datagram, and then routes the IPv6 datagram exactly
as it would if it had received the IPv6 datagram from a directly connected IPv6
neighbor.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Recall from earlier that destination-based forwarding as the two steps of
looking up a destination IP address (“match”), then sending the packet into the
switching fabric to the specified output port (“action”).
</p>

<p>
now consider a significantly more general “match-plus-action” paradigm, where
the “match” can be made over multiple header fields associated with different
protocols at different layers in the protocol stack. The “action” can include
forwarding the packet to one or more output ports (as in destination-based
forwarding), load balancing packets across multiple outgoing interfaces that
lead to a service (as in load balancing), rewriting header values (as in NAT),
purposefully blocking/dropping a packet (as in a firewall), sending a packet to
a special server for further processing and action (as in DPI), and more.
</p>


<p>
In generalized forwarding, a match-plus-action table generalizes the notion of
the destination-based forwarding table. Because forwarding decisions may be made
using network-layer and/or link-layer source and destination addresses, the
forwarding devices are more accurately described as “packet switches” rather
than layer 3 “routers” or layer 2 to these devices as packet switches.
</p>

<p>
Figure 4.28 Generalized forwarding: Each packet switch contains a
match-plus-action table that is computed and distributed by a remote controller
</p>

<p>
Figure 4.28 shows a match-plus-action table in each packet switch, with the
table being computed, installed, and updated by a remote controller. We note
that while it is possible for the control components at the individual packet
switch to interact with each other, in practice generalized match-plus-action
capabilities are implemented via a remote controller that computes, installs,
and updates these tables.
</p>

<p>
OpenFlow a highly visible and successful standard that has pioneered the notion
of the match-plus-action forwarding abstraction and controllers, as well as the
SDN revolution more generally.
</p>

<p>
Each entry in the match-plus-action forwarding table, known as a <code>flow table</code> in
OpenFlow, includes:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A set of header field values to which an incoming packet will be matched. As
in the case of destination-based forwarding, hardware-based matching is most
rapidly performed in TCAM memory, with more than a million destination address
entries being possible. A packet that matches no flow table entry can be
dropped or sent to the remote controller for more processing. In practice, a
flow table may be implemented by multiple flow tables for performance or cost
reasons.</li>
<li>A set of counters that are updated as packets are matched to flow table
entries. These counters might include the number of packets that have been
matched by that table entry, and the time since the table entry was last
updated.</li>
<li>A set of actions to be taken when a packet matches a flow table entry. These
actions might be to forward the packet to a given output port, to drop the
packet, makes copies of the packet and sent them to multiple output ports,
and/or to rewrite selected header fields.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
Recall that a link-layer (layer 2) frame arriving to a packet switch will
contain a network-layer (layer 3) datagram as its payload, which in turn will
typically contain a transport-layer (layer 4) segment.
</p>

<p>
OpenFlow’s match abstraction allows for a match to be made on selected fields
from three layers of protocol headers (thus rather brazenly defying the layering
principle). Since we’ve not yet covered the link layer, suffice it to say that
the source and destination MAC addresses are the link-layer addresses associated
with the frame’s sending and receiving interfaces; by forwarding on the basis of
Ethernet addresses rather than IP addresses, we can see that an OpenFlow-enabled
device can equally perform as a router (layer-3 device) forwarding datagrams as
well as a switch (layer-2 device) forwarding frames. The Ethernet type field
corresponds to the upper layer protocol (e.g., IP) to which the frame’s payload
will be de-multiplexed, and the VLAN fields are concerned with so-called virtual
LANs.
</p>

<p>
Flow table entries may also have wildcards. For example, an IP address of
128.119.*.* in a flow table will match the corresponding address field of any
datagram that has 128.119 as the first 16 bits of its address.
</p>

<p>
Each flow table entry also has an associated priority. If a packet matches
multiple flow table entries, the selected match and corresponding action will be
that of the highest priority entry with which the packet matches.

<h3 id="org7945f9f"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Action</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
each flow table entry has a list of zero or more actions that determine the
processing that is to be applied to a packet that matches a flow table entry. If
there are multiple actions, they are performed in the order specified in the
list.
</p>

<p>
Among the most important possible actions are:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Forwarding</dt><dd><p>
An incoming packet may be
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>forwarded to a particular physical output port,</li>
<li>broadcast over all ports (except the port on which it arrived) or</li>
<li>multicast over a selected set of ports.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The packet may be encapsulated and sent to the remote controller for this
device. That controller then may (or may not) take some action on that packet,
including installing new flow table entries, and may return the packet to the
device for forwarding under the updated set of flow table rules.
</p></dd>
<dt>Dropping</dt><dd>A flow table entry with no action indicates that a matched packet
should be dropped.</dd>
<dt>Modify-field</dt><dd>The values in ten packet header fields (all layer 2, 3, and 4

forwarded to the chosen output port.</dd>

<p>
The network has 6 hosts (h1 to h6) and three packet switches (s1 to s3), each
with four local interfaces (1 through 4). We’ll consider a number of
network-wide behaviors that we’d like to implement, and the flow table entreies
in s1, s2 and s3 needed to implement this behavior.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0e3b9e8" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org0e3b9e8"><span class="section-number-4">3.3.1</span> A First Example: Simple Forwarding</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-3-1">
<p>
As a very simple example, suppose that the desired forwarding behavior is that
packets from h5 or h6 destined to h3 or h4 are to be forwarded from s3 to s1,
and then from s1 to s2 (thus completely avoiding the use of the link between s3
and s2). The flow table entry in s1 would be:
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">s1 Flow Table (Example 1)</td>
<td class="org-left">&#xa0;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">Match</td>
<td class="org-left">Action</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">Ingress Port = 1 ; IP Src = 10.3.*.* ; IP Dst = 10.2.*.*</td>
<td class="org-left">Forward(4)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">&#x2026;</td>
<td class="org-left">&#x2026;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
Of course, we’ll also need a flow table entry in s3 so that datagrams sent from
h5 or h6 are forwarded to s1 over outgoing interface 3:
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">s3 Flow Table (Example 1)</td>
<td class="org-left">&#xa0;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">Match</td>
<td class="org-left">Action</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">IP Src = 10.3.*.* ; IP Dst = 10.2.*.*</td>
<td class="org-left">Forward(3)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">&#x2026;</td>
<td class="org-left">&#x2026;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
Lastly, we’ll also need a flow table entry in s2 to complete this first example,
so that datagrams arriving from s1 are forwarded to their destination, either
host h3 or h4:
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />

<td class="org-left">Match</td>
<td class="org-left">Action</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">Ingress port = 2 ; IP Dst = 10.2.0.3</td>
<td class="org-left">Forward(3)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">Ingress port = 2 ; IP Dst = 10.2.0.4</td>
<td class="org-left">Forward(4)</td>

<h4 id="org804980d"><span class="section-number-4">3.3.2</span> A Second Example: Load Balancing</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-3-2">
<p>
As a second example, let’s consider a load-balancing scenario, where datagrams
from h3 destined to 10.1.*.* are to be forwarded over the direct link between s2
and s1, while datagrams from h4 destined to 10.1.*.* are to be forwarded over
the link between s2 and s3 (and then from s3 to s1). Note that this behavior
couldn’t be achieved with IP’s destination-based forwarding. In this case, the
flow table in s2 would be:
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">s2 Flow Table (Example 2)</td>
<td class="org-left">&#xa0;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">Match</td>
<td class="org-left">Action</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">Ingress port = 3; IP Dst = 10.1.*.*</td>
<td class="org-left">Forward(2)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">Ingress port = 4; IP Dst = 10.1.*.*</td>
<td class="org-left">Forward(1)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">&#x2026;</td>
<td class="org-left">&#x2026;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
Flow table entries are also needed at s1 to forward the datagrams received from
s2 to either h1 or h2; and flow table entries are needed at s3 to forward
datagrams received on interface 4 from s2 over interface 3 towards s1.
</p>

<p>
See if you can figure out these flow table entries at s1 and s3.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-3-3">
<p>
As a third example, let’s consider a firewall scenario in which s2 wants only to
receive (on any of its interfaces) traffic sent from hosts attached to s3.

</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">&#x2026;</td>
<td class="org-left">&#x2026;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
If there were no other entries in s2’s flow table, then only traffic from
10.3.*.* would be forwarded to the hosts attached to s2.
