</p>

<p>
we naturally wonder how packets are sent across the individual links that make
up the end-to-end communication path.
</p>

<p>
How are the network-layer datagrams encapsulated in the link-layer frames for
transmission over a single link?
</p>

<p>
Are different link-layer protocols used in the different links along the
communication path?
</p>

<p>
How are transmission conflicts in broadcast links resolved?
</p>

<p>
Is there addressing at the link layer and, if so, how does the link-layer
addressing operate with the network-layer addressing we learned about in Chapter
4?
</p>

<p>
And what exactly is the difference between a switch and a router?
</p>

<p>
there are two fundamentally ­different types of link-layer channels. The first
type are broadcast channels, which connect multiple hosts in wireless LANs,
satellite networks, and hybrid fiber-coaxial cable (HFC) access networks. Since
many hosts are connected to the same broadcast communication channel, a
so-called medium access protocol is needed to coordinate frame transmission. In
some cases, a central controller may be used to coordinate transmissions; in
other cases, the hosts themselves coordinate transmissions.
</p>

<p>
The second type of link-layer channel is the point-to-point communication link,
such as that often found between two routers connected by a long-distance link,
or between a user’s office computer and the nearby Ethernet switch to which it
is connected. Coordinating access to a point-to-point link is simpler; the
reference material on this book’s Web site has a detailed discussion of the
Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), which is used in settings ranging from dial-up
service over a telephone line to high-speed point-to-point frame transport over
fiber-optic links.

<h3 id="orga174b25">The Services Provided by the Link Layer</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga174b25">
<p>
Although the basic service of any link layer is to move a datagram from one node
to an adjacent nodeover a single communication link, the details of the provided
service can vary from one link-layerprotocol to the next.

<h4 id="org9c246e3">Framing</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9c246e3">
<p>
Almost all link-layer protocols encapsulate each network-layer datagram within a
link-layer frame before transmission over the link. A frame consists of a data
field, in which the network-layer datagram is inserted, and a number of header
fields. The structure of the frame is specified by the link-layer
protocol. We’ll see several different frame formats when we examine specific
link-layer protocols in the second half of this chapter.

<h4 id="org8fd72d8">Link access</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8fd72d8">
<p>
A medium access control (MAC) protocol specifies the rules by which a frame is
transmitted onto the link. For point-to-point links that have a single sender at
one end of the link a nda single receiver at the other end of the link, the MAC
protocol is simple (or nonexistent)—the sender can send a frame whenever the
link is idle. The more interesting case is when multiple nodes share a single
broadcast link—the so-called multiple access problem. Here, the MAC protocol
serves to coordinate the frame transmissions of the many nodes.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org993b014" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org993b014">Reliable delivery</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org993b014">
<p>
When a link-layer protocol provides reliable delivery service, it guarantees to
move each network-layer datagram across the link without error. Recall that
certain transport-layer protocols (such as TCP) also provide a reliable delivery
service. Similar to a transport-layer reliable delivery service, a link-layer
reliable delivery service can be achieved with acknowledgments and
retransmissions (see Section 3.4). A link-layer reliable delivery service is
often used for links that are prone to high error rates, such as a wireless
link, with the goal of correcting an error locally—on the link where the error
occurs—rather than forcing an end-to-end retransmission of the data by a
transport- or application-layer protocol. However, link-layer reliable delivery
can be considered an unnecessary overhead for low bit-error links, including
fiber, coax, and many twisted-pair copper links. For this reason, many wired
link-layer protocols do not provide a reliable delivery service.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orge8372c8" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orge8372c8">Error detection and correction</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge8372c8">
<p>
The link-layer hardware in a receiving node can incorrectly decide that a bit in
a frame is zero when it was transmitted as a one, and vice versa. Such bit
errors are introduced by signal attenuation and electromagnetic noise. Because
there is no need to forward a datagram that has an error, many link-layer
protocols provide a mechanism to detect such bit errors.
</p>

<p>
This is done by having the transmitting node include error-detection bits in the
frame, and having the receiving node perform an error check. Recall from
Chapters 3 and 4 that the Internet’s transport layer and network layer also
provide a limited form of error detection—the Internet checksum. Error detection
in the link layer is usually more sophisticated and is implemented in
hardware. Error correction is similar to error detection, except that a receiver
not only detects when bit errors have occurred in the frame but also determines
exactly where in the frame the errors have occurred (and then corrects these
errors).
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6b481a2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6b481a2">Where Is the Link Layer Implemented?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6b481a2">
<p>
for the most part, the link layer is implemented in a network adapter, also
sometimes known as a <code>network interface card (NIC)</code>. At the heart of the network
adapter is the link-layer controller, usually a single, special-purpose chip
that implements many of the link-layer services (framing, link access, error
detection, and so on). Thus, much of a link-layer controller’s functionality is
implemented in hardware.
</p>

<p>
imagen 6.2
</p>

<p>
On the sending side, the controller takes a datagram that has been created and
stored in host memory by the higher layers of the protocol stack, encapsulates
the datagram in a link-layer frame (filling in the frame’s various fields), and
then transmits the frame into the communication link, following the link-access
protocol.
</p>

<p>
On the receiving side, a controller receives the entire frame, and extracts the
network-layer datagram.
</p>

<p>
If the link layer performs error detection, then it is the sending controller
that sets the error-detection bits in the frame header and it is the receiving
controller that performs error detection
</p>

<p>
while most of the link layer is implemented in hardware, part of the link layer
is implemented in software that runs on the host’s CPU. The software components
of the link layer implement higher-level link-layer functionality such as
assembling link-layer addressing information and activating the controller
hardware.
</p>

<p>
On the receiving side, link-layer software responds to controller
interrupts (e.g., due to the receipt of one or more frames), handling error
conditions and passing a datagram up to the network layer. Thus, the link layer
is a combination of hardware and software—the place in the protocol stack where
software meets hardware.

<h2 id="org1251407">Multiple Access Links and Protocols</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1251407">
<p>
A <code>point-to-point link</code> consists of a single sender at one end of the link and a
single receiver at the other end of the link. Many link-layer protocols have
been designed for point-to-point links; the point-to-point protocol (PPP) and
high-level data link control (HDLC) are two such protocols.
</p>

<p>
a <code>broadcast link</code>, can have multiple sending and receiving nodes all connected
to the same, single, shared broadcast channel. The term broadcast is used here
because when any one node transmits a frame, the channel broadcasts the frame
and each of the other nodes receives a copy. Ethernet and wireless LANs are
examples of broadcast link-layer technologies.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>the <code>multiple access problem</code></dt><dd>how to coordinate the access of multiple
sending and receiving nodes to a shared broadcast channel</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Computer networks have protocols — so-called multiple access protocols — by
which nodes regulate their transmission into the shared broadcast channel.
</p>

<p>
When multiple nodes transmit frames on a channel at the same time, all of the
nodes receive multiple frames at the same time; that is, the transmitted frames
<code>collide</code> at all of the receivers. Typically, when there is a collision, none of
the receiving nodes can make any sense of any of the frames that were
transmitted. Thus, all the frames involved in the collision are lost, and
the broadcast channel is wasted during the collision interval.
</p>

<p>
It is the multiple access protocol's job to coordinate the transmission of the
active nodes.
</p>

<p>
we can classify just about any multiple access protocol as belonging to one of
three categories:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>channel partitioning protocols,</li>
<li>random access protocols, and</li>
<li>taking-turns protocols.</li>
</ul>

<p>
desirable characteristics of a multiple-access-protocol for a broadcast channel
of rate \(R\) bits per second:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>When only one node has data to send, that node has a throughput of R bps.</li>
<li>When M nodes have data to send, each of these nodes has a throughput of R/M
bps. This need not necessarily imply that each of the M nodes always has an
instantaneous rate of R/M, but rather that each node should have an average
transmission rate of R/M over some suitably defined interval of time.</li>
<li>The protocol is decentralized; that is, there is no master node that
represents a single point of failure for the network.</li>
<li>The protocol is simple, so that it is inexpensive to implement.</li>
</ol>

code) in spite of interfering transmissions by other nodes.

Assume the following:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>All frames consist of exactly L bits.</li>
<li>Time is divided into slots of size L/R seconds (that is, a slot equals the
time to transmit one frame).</li>
<li>Nodes start to transmit frames only at the beginnings of slots.</li>
<li>The nodes are synchronized so that each node knows when the slots begin.</li>
<li>If two or more frames collide in a slot, then all the nodes detect the
collision event before the slot ends.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Operation:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When the node has a fresh frame to send, it waits until the beginning of the
next slot and transmits the entire frame in the slot.</li>
<li>If there isn’t a collision, the node has successfully transmitted its frame
and thus need not consider retransmitting the frame. (The node can prepare a
new frame for transmission, if it has one.)</li>
<li>If there is a collision, the node detects the collision before the end of the
slot. The node retransmits its frame in each subsequent slot with probability
\(p\) until the frame is transmitted without a collision.</li>
</ul>

<p>
allows a node to transmit continuously at the full rate, R, when that node is
the only active node. (A node is said to be active if it has frames to send.)
</p>

<p>
highly decentralized, because each node detects collisions and independently
decides when to retransmit.
</p>

<p>
however,it requires the slots to be synchronized in the nodes
</p>

<p>
Slotted ALOHA works well when there is only one active node, but how ­efficient
is it when there are multiple active nodes?
</p>

<p>

</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>when there are multiple active nodes, a certain fraction of the slots will
have collisions and will therefore be “wasted.”</li>
<li>another fraction of the slots will be empty because all active nodes refrain
from transmitting as a result of the probabilistic transmission policy.</li>
</ol>

<p>
the only “unwasted” slots will be those in which exactly one node transmits. A
slot in which exactly one node transmits is said to be a <code>successful slot</code>. The
efficiency of a slotted multiple access protocol is defined to be the long-run
fraction of successful slots in the case when there are a large number of active
nodes, each always having a large number of frames to send.
</p>

<p>
the maximum efficiency of the protocol is given by p=1/e=0,37.
</p>

<p>
when a large number of nodes have many frames to transmit,then (at best) only 37
percent of the slots do useful work. Thus the effective transmission rate of
the channel is not R bps but only 0.37 R bps!

The polling protocol requires one of the nodes to be designated as a master
node. The master node polls each of the nodes in a round-robin fashion.
</p>

<p>
In particular, the master node first sends a message to node 1, saying that it
can transmit up to some maximum number of frames. After node 1 transmits some
frames, the master node tells node 2 it can transmit up to the maximum number of
frames. (The master node can determine when a node has finished sending its
frames by observing the lack of a signal on the channel.)

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org6f8ae03">
<p>
A small, special-purpose frame known as a <code>token</code> is exchanged among the
nodes in some fixed order. When a node receives a token, it holds onto the
token only if it has some frames to transmit; otherwise, it immediately
forwards the token to the next node. If a node does have frames to transmit
when it receives the token, it sends up to a maximum number of frames and
then forwards the token to the next node. Token passing is decentralized and
highly efficient. But for example, the failure of one node can crash the
entire channel. Or if a node accidentally neglects to release the token,
then some recovery procedure must be invoked to get the token back in
circulation.

<h3 id="orge98ac2f">Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications (DOCSIS)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge98ac2f">
<p>
Recall that a cable access network typically connects several thousand
residential cable modems to a cable modem termination system (CMTS) at the
cable network headend.
</p>

<p>
DOCSIS uses FDM to divide the downstream (CMTS to modem) and upstream (modem
to CMTS) network segments into multiple frequency channels.
</p>

<p>
Each downstream channel is 6 MHz wide, with a maximum throughput of approximately
40 Mbps per channel;
</p>

<p>
Each upstream channel has a maximum channel width of 6.4 MHz, and a
maximum upstream throughput of approximately 30 Mbps.
</p>

<p>
Each channel (upstream and downstream) is a broadcast channel.
</p>

<p>
Frames transmitted on the downstream channel by the CMTS are received by all
cable modems receiving that channel; since there is just a single CMTS
transmitting into the downstream channel, there is no multiple access
problem.
</p>

<p>
In the upstream direction, since multiple cable modems share the same
upstream channel (frequency) to the CMTS, collisions can potentially occur.
</p>

<p>
imagen 6.14
</p>

<p>
each upstream channel is divided into intervals of time (TDM-like), each
containing a sequence of mini-slots during which cable modems can transmit to
the CMTS. The CMTS explicitly grants permission to individual cable modems to
transmit during specific mini-slots by sending a
control message known as a <code>MAP message</code> on a downstream channel to specify
which cable modem (with data to send) can transmit during which mini-slot for
the interval of time specified in the control message.
</p>

<p>
mini-slots are allocated to cable modems, so there are no colliding
transmissions during a mini-slot.
</p>

<p>
to know which cable modems have data to send (and therefore, be assigned a
mini-slot), the cable modems send mini-slot-request frames to the CMTS during
a special set of interval mini-slots that are dedicated for this purpose.
</p>

<p>
These mini-slot-request frames are transmitted in a random access manner and
so may collide with each other. A cable modem can neither sense whether the
upstream channel is busy nor detect collisions. Instead, the cable modem
infers that its mini-slot-request frame experienced a collision if it does
not receive a response to the requested allocation in the next downstream
control message. When a collision is inferred, a cable modem uses binary
exponential backoff to defer the retransmission of its mini-slot-request
frame to a future time slot. When there is little traffic on the upstream
channel, a cable modem may actually transmit data frames during slots
nominally assigned for mini-slot-request frames (and thus avoid having to
wait for a mini-slot assignment).

<p>
Figure 6.15 shows a switched local network connecting three departments, two
servers and a router with four switches. Because these switches operate at the
link layer, they switch link-layer frames (rather than network-layer
datagrams), don’t recognize network-layer addresses, and don’t use routing
algorithms to determine paths through the network of layer-2 switches. Instead
of using IP addresses, we will soon see that they use link-layer addresses to
forward link-layer frames through the network of switches.

<p>
hosts and routers have adapters (network interfaces) which have a link-layer
address.
</p>

<p>
host or router with multiple network interfaces will thus have multiple
link-layer addresses associated with it, just as it would also have multiple
IP addresses associated with it. however, link-layer switches do not have
link-layer addresses associated with their interfaces that connect to hosts
and routers. This is because the job of the link-layer switch is to carry
datagrams between hosts and routers; a switch does this job transparently,
that is, without the host or router having to explicitly address the frame
to the intervening switch.
</p>


<p>
these address are called <code>LAN addresses</code>, <code>physical addresses</code> or <code>MAC
    addresses</code>, and are of 6 bytes long. They can be changed via software.
</p>

<p>
no two adapters have the same address, because the ieee manages the mac
address space. an adapter manufacturer can buy an address space of 2<sup>24</sup>
addresses, having an available space to manufacture 2<sup>24</sup> adapters.
</p>

<p>
An adapter’s MAC address has a flat structure (as opposed to a hierarchical
structure) and doesn’t change no matter where the adapter goes.
</p>

<p>
When an adapter wants to send a frame to some destination adapter, the
sending adapter inserts the destination adapter’s MAC address into the frame
and then sends the frame into the LAN.  As we will soon see, a switch
occasionally broadcasts an incoming frame onto all of its interfaces.
because frames are broadcasted to all adapters, an adapters has to check if
a frame is addressed to it.  However, sometimes a sending adapter does want
all the other adapters on the LAN to receive and process the frame it is
about to send. In this case, the sending adapter inserts a special <code>MAC
    broadcast address</code> into the destination address field of the frame.

<p>

</p>

<p>
assume in this section that the switch broadcasts all frames; that is,
whenever a switch receives a frame on one interface, it forwards the frame
on all of its other interfaces.
</p>

<p>
uppose that the host with IP address 222.222.222.220 wants to send an IP
datagram to host 222.222.222.222. In this example, both the source and
destination are in the same subnet.
</p>

<p>
To send a datagram, the source must give its adapter not only the IP
datagram but also the MAC address for destination 222.222.222.222. The
sending adapter will then construct a link-layer frame containing the
destination’s MAC address and send the frame into the LAN.
</p>

<p>
But how does the sending host, know the MAC address of destination host?
</p>

<p>
The solution is ARP. n ARP module in the sending host takes any IP address
on the same LAN as input, and returns the corresponding MAC address.
</p>

<p>
ARP resolves an IP address to a MAC address for hosts and router interfaces
in the same subnet.
</p>

<p>
Each host and router has an <code>ARP table</code> in its memory, which contains
mappings of IP addresses to MAC addresses.
</p>

</table>

<p>
The ARP table also contains a time-to-live (TTL) value, which indicates when
each mapping will be deleted from the table. Note that a table does not
necessarily contain an entry for every host and router on the subnet; some
may have never been entered into the table, and others may have expired.
</p>

<p>
if the ARP table doesn’t currently have an entry for the destination, the
sender uses the ARP protocol to resolve the address. First, the sender
constructs a special packet called an <code>ARP packet</code>. An ARP packet has
several fields, including the sending and receiving IP and MAC
addresses. Both ARP query and response packets have the same format. The
purpose of the ARP query packet is to query all the other hosts and routers
on the subnet to determine the MAC address corresponding to the IP address
that is being resolved.
</p>

<p>
the query ARP message is sent within a broadcast frame, whereas the response
ARP message is sent within a standard frame.
</p>

<p>
ARP is plug-and-play; that is, an ARP table gets built ­automatically—it
doesn’t have to be configured by a system administrator. And if a host
becomes disconnected from the subnet, its entry is eventually deleted from
the other ARP tables in the subnet.
</p>

<p>
ARP is a protocol that arguably lies in between the link layer and the
network layer.

two ARP modules, and two adapters. Of course, each adapter in the network has
