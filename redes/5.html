<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Protocol rdt3.0 is a functionally correct protocol, but its performance problem
is the fact that it is a stop-and-wait protocol.
</p>

<p>
imagen 3.16
</p>

<p>
This stop-and-wait protocol limits the sender <code>utilization</code> of the channel (the
amount of time the sender actually sends bits into the channel).
</p>

<p>
image 3.17
</p>


<p>
The solution to this particular performance problem is simple: Rather than operate in a stop-and-wait
manner, the sender is allowed to send multiple packets without waiting for acknowledgments.
</p>

<p>
illustrated in Figure 3.17(b). Figure 3.18(b) shows that if the sender is allowed to transmit three packets
before having to wait for acknowledgments, the utilization of the sender is essentially tripled.
</p>

<p>
this technique is known as <code>pipelining</code>. Pipelining has the following consequences
for reliable data transfer protocols:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The range of sequence numbers must be increased, since each in-transit packet
(not counting retransmissions) must have a unique sequence number and there
may be multiple, in-transit, unacknowledged packets.</li>
<li>The sender and receiver sides of the protocols may have to buffer more than
one packet. Minimally, the sender will have to buffer packets that have been
transmitted but not yet acknowledged. Buffering of correctly received packets
may also be needed at the receiver, as discussed below.</li>
<li>The range of sequence numbers needed and the buffering requirements will
depend on the manner in which a data transfer protocol responds to lost,
corrupted, and overly delayed packets. Two basic approaches toward pipelined
error recovery can be identified: <code>Go-Back-N</code> and <code>selective repeat</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="org9cfadd7"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> Go-Back-N (GBN)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
In a Go-Back-N (GBN) protocol, the sender is allowed to transmit multiple packets (when available)
without waiting for an acknowledgment, but is constrained to have no more than some maximum
allowable number, N, of unacknowledged packets in the pipeline.
</p>

<p>
imagen 3.19
</p>

<p>
Figure 3.19 shows the sender’s view of the range of sequence numbers in a GBN
protocol. If we define <code>base</code> to be the sequence number of the oldest
unacknowledged packet and <code>nextseqnum</code> to be the smallest unused sequence number
(that is, the sequence number of the next packet to be sent), then four
intervals in the range of sequence numbers can be identified.
</p>

<p>
Sequence numbers in the interval
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>[ 0, base-1 ]</code> correspond to packets that have already been transmitted and
acknowledged.</li>
<li><code>[base, nextseqnum-1]</code> corresponds to packets that have been sent but not yet
acknowledged. Sequence numbers in the interval</li>
<li><code>[nextseqnum, base+N-1]</code> can be used for packets that can be sent immediately,
should data arrive from the upper layer.</li>
<li><code>[base+N, ...]</code> cannot be used until an unacknowledged packet currently in the
pipeline (specifically, the packet with sequence number <code>base</code> ) has been
acknowledged.</li>
</ul>

<p>
the range of permissible sequence numbers for transmitted but not yet
acknowledged packets can be viewed as a window of size <code>N</code> over the range of
sequence numbers.
</p>

<p>
As the protocol operates, this window slides forward over the sequence number
space. For this reason, <code>N</code> is often referred to as the <code>window size</code> and the
GBN protocol itself as a <code>sliding-window protocol</code>.
</p>

<p>
You might be wondering <b>why we would even limit the number of outstanding,
unacknowledged packets to a value of N?*</b>. <b>Why not allow an
unlimited number of such packets?</b>
</p>

<p>
flow control is one reason to impose a limit on the sender. We’ll examine
another reason to do so when we study TCP congestion control.
</p>

<p>
In practice, a packet’s sequence number is carried in a fixed-length field in the packet header. If k is the number of bits in the packet sequence number field, the range of sequence numbers is thus
</p>


<p>
Figures 3.20 and 3.21 give an extended FSM description of the sender and receiver sides of an ACK-based, NAK-free, GBN protocol.
</p>

<p>
imagen 3.20
</p>

<p>
imagen 3.21
</p>

<p>
we have added variables (similar to programming-language variables) for base and
nextseqnum , and added operations on these variables and conditional actions
involving these variables.
</p>

<p>
The GBN sender must respond to three types of events:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Invocation from above</dt><dd><p>
When rdt<sub>send</sub>() is called from above, the sender
first checks to see if the window is full, that is, whether there are N
outstanding, unacknowledged packets.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If the window is not full, a packet is created and sent, and variables are
appropriately updated.</li>
<li>If the window is full, the sender simply returns the data back to the upper
layer, an implicit indication that the window is full.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The upper layer would presumably then have to try again later. In a real
implementation, the sender would more likely have either buffered (but not
immediately sent) this data, or would have a synchronization mechanism (for
example, a semaphore or a flag) that would allow the upper layer to call
rdt<sub>send</sub>() only when the window is not full.
</p></dd>
<dt>Receipt of an ACK</dt><dd>In our GBN protocol, an acknowledgment for a packet with
sequence number n will be taken to be a <code>cumulative acknowledgment</code>,
indicating that all packets with a sequence number up to and including n have
been correctly received at the receiver.</dd>
<dt>A timeout event</dt><dd>The protocol’s name, “Go-Back-N,” is derived from the
sender’s behavior in the presence of lost or overly delayed packets. As in the
stop-and-wait protocol, a timer will again be used to recover from lost data
or acknowledgment packets. If a timeout occurs, the sender resends all packets
that have been previously sent but that have not yet been acknowledged. Our
sender in Figure 3.20 uses only a single timer, which can be thought of as a
timer for the oldest transmitted but not yet acknowledged packet. If an ACK is
received but there are still additional transmitted but not yet acknowledged
packets, the timer is restarted. If there are no outstanding, unacknowledged
packets, the timer is stopped.</dd>
</dl>


<p>
The receiver’s actions in GBN are :
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If a packet with sequence number n is received correctly and is in order (that
is, the data last delivered to the upper layer came from a packet with
sequence number ), the receiver sends an ACK for packet n and delivers the
data portion of the packet to the upper layer.</li>
<li>In all other cases, the receiver discards the packet and resends an ACK for
the most recently received in-order packet. Note that since packets are
delivered one at a time to the upper layer, if packet k has been received and
delivered, then all packets with a sequence number lower than k have also been
delivered. Thus, the use of <code>cumulative acknowledgments</code> is a natural choice for GBN.</li>
</ul>


<p>
<b>In our GBN protocol, the receiver discards out-of-order packets.</b>
</p>

<p>
Recall that the receiver must deliver data in order to the upper layer. Suppose
now that packet n is expected, but packet n+1 arrives. Because data must be
delivered in order, the receiver could buffer packet n+1 and then deliver
this packet to the upper layer after it had later received and delivered packet
n. However, if packet n is lost, both it and packet n+1 will eventually be
retransmitted as a result of the GBN retransmission rule at the sender.
</p>

<p>
Thus, the receiver can simply discard packet.
</p>

<p>
The advantage is the simplicity of receiver buffering—the receiver need not
buffer any out-of-order packets. Thus, while the sender must maintain the upper
and lower bounds of its window and the position of <code>nextseqnum</code> within this
window, the only piece of information the receiver need maintain is the sequence
number of the next in-order packet held in the variable <code>expectedseqnum</code>.
</p>

<p>
the disadvantage of throwing away a correctly received packet is that the
subsequent retransmission of that packet might be lost or garbled and thus even
more retransmissions would be required.
</p>

<p>
imagen 3.22
</p>

<p>
Figure 3.22 shows the operation of the GBN protocol for the case of a window
size of four packets. Because of this window size limitation, the sender sends
packets 0 through 3 but then must wait for one or more of these packets to be
acknowledged before proceeding. As each successive ACK (for example, ACK0 and
ACK1 ) is received, the window slides forward and the sender can transmit one
new packet (pkt4 and pkt5, respectively). On the receiver side, packet 2 is lost
and thus packets 3, 4, and 5 are found to be out of order and are discarded.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org2f48578" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2f48578"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Selective Repeat (SR)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
There are scenarios in which GBN itself suffers from performance problems. In
particular, when the window size and bandwidth-delay product are both large,
many packets can be in the pipeline. A single packet error can thus cause GBN to
retransmit a large number of packets.
</p>

<p>
As the name suggests, selective-repeat protocols avoid unnecessary
retransmissions by having the sender retransmit only those packets that it
suspects were received in error (that is, were lost or corrupted) at the
receiver. This individual, as-needed, retransmission will require that the
receiver individually acknowledge correctly received packets.
</p>

<p>
A window size of N will again be used to limit the number of outstanding,
unacknowledged packets in the pipeline. However, unlike GBN, the sender will
have already received ACKs for some of the packets in the window.
</p>

<p>
The SR receiver will acknowledge a correctly received packet whether or not it
is in order. Out-of-order packets are buffered until any missing packets (that
is, packets with lower sequence numbers) are received, at which point a batch of
packets can be delivered in order to the upper layer.
</p>

<p>

<p>
imagen 3.24
</p>

<p>
imagen 3.25
</p>

<p>
It is important to note that in Step 2 in Figure 3.25, the receiver reacknowledges (rather than ignores)
already received packets with certain sequence numbers below the current window base.
</p>

<p>
imagen 3.26
</p>

<p>
Given the sender and receiver sequence number spaces in Figure 3.23, for
example, if there is no ACK for packet send<sub>base</sub> propagating from the receiver
to the sender, the sender will eventually retransmit packet send<sub>base</sub> , even
though it is clear (to us, not the sender!) that the receiver has already
received that packet. If the receiver were not to acknowledge this packet, the
sender’s window would never move forward! This example illustrates an important
aspect of SR protocols (and many other protocols as well). The sender and
receiver will not always have an identical view of what has been received
correctly and what has not. For SR protocols, this means that the sender and
receiver windows will not always coincide.
</p>


<p>
The lack of synchronization between sender and receiver windows has important
consequences when we are faced with the reality of a finite range of sequence
numbers.
</p>

<pre class="example">
<code>Consider what could happen, for example, with a finite range of four packet</code>
<code>sequence numbers, 0, 1, 2, 3, and a window size of three.</code>
<code></code>
<code>Suppose packets 0 through 2 are transmitted and correctly received and</code>
<code>acknowledged at the receiver. At this point, the receiver’s window is over the</code>
<code>fourth, fifth, and sixth packets, which have sequence numbers 3, 0, and 1,</code>
<code>respectively. Now consider two scenarios.</code>
<code></code>
<code>In the first scenario, shown in Figure 3.27(a), the ACKs for the first three</code>
<code>packets are lost and the sender retransmits these packets. The receiver thus</code>
<code>next receives a packet with sequence number 0—a copy of the first packet sent.</code>
<code></code>
<code>In the second scenario, shown in Figure 3.27(b), the ACKs for the first three</code>
<code>packets are all delivered correctly. The sender thus moves its window forward</code>
<code>and sends the fourth, fifth, and sixth packets, with sequence numbers 3, 0, and</code>
<code>1, respectively. The packet with sequence number 3 is lost, but the packet with</code>
<code>sequence number 0 arrives—a packet containing new data.</code>
<code></code>
<code>Now consider the receiver’s viewpoint in Figure 3.27, which has a figurative</code>
<code>curtain between the sender and the receiver, since the receiver cannot “see” the</code>
<code>actions taken by the sender. All the receiver observes is the sequence of</code>
<code>messages it receives from the channel and sends into the channel. As far as it</code>
<code>is concerned, the two scenarios in Figure 3.27 are identical. There is no way of</code>
<code>distinguishing the retransmission of the first packet from an original</code>
<code>transmission of the fifth packet. Clearly, a window size that is 1 less than the</code>
<code>size of the sequence number space won’t work. But how small must the window size</code>
<code>be? A problem at the end of the chapter asks you to show that the window size</code>
<code>must be less than or equal to half the size of the sequence number space for SR</code>
<code>protocols.</code>

<h2 id="org2de545f"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Connection-Oriented Transport: TCP</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
TCP is defined in RFC 793, RFC 1122, RFC 1323, RFC 2018, RFC 2581.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org905ba55" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org905ba55"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> The TCP Connection</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
TCP is said to be <code>connection-oriented</code> because before one application process
can begin to send data to another, the two processes must first “handshake” with
each other—that is, they must send some preliminary segments to each other to
establish the parameters of the ensuing data transfer. As part of TCP connection
establishment, both sides of the connection will initialize many TCP state
variables associated with the TCP connection.
</p>

<p>
The TCP “connection” is not an end-to-end TDM or FDM circuit as in a
circuit-switched network. Instead, the “connection” is a logical one, with
common state residing only in the TCPs in the two communicating end systems.
Recall that because the TCP protocol runs only in the end systems and not in the
intermediate network elements (routers and link-layer switches), the
intermediate network elements do not maintain TCP connection state. In fact, the
intermediate routers are completely oblivious to TCP connections; they see
datagrams, not connections.
</p>

<p>
A TCP connection provides a full-duplex service: If there is a TCP connection
between Process A on one host and Process B on another host, then
application-layer data can flow from Process A to Process B at the same time as
application-layer data flows from Process B to Process A. A TCP connection is
also always point-to-point, that is, between a single sender and a single
receiver. So- called “multicasting” —the transfer of data from one sender to
many receivers in a single send operation—is not possible with TCP.
</p>


<p>
Suppose a process running in one host wants to initiate a connection with
another process in another host. the client first sends a special TCP segment;
the server responds with a second special TCP segment; and finally the client
responds again with a third special segment. The first two segments carry no
payload, that is, no application-layer data; the third of these segments may
carry a payload.
</p>

<p>
this connection-establishment procedure is often referred to as a <code>three-way
handshake</code>.
</p>

<p>
Once a TCP connection is established, the two application processes can send
data to each other. Let’s consider the sending of data from the client
to the server. The client passes a stream of data through the
socket, then the data is in the hands of TCP running in the client.
</p>

<p>
TCP directs this data to the connection’s <code>send buffer</code>, which is one of the
buffers that is set aside during the initial three-way handshake. From time to
time, TCP will grab chunks of data from the send buffer and pass the data to the
network layer.
</p>

<p>
The maximum amount of data that can be grabbed and placed in a segment is
limited by the <code>maximum segment size (MSS)</code>. The MSS is typically set by first
determining the length of the largest link-layer frame that can be sent by the
local sending host (the so- called <code>maximum transmission unit, MTU</code>), and then
setting the MSS to ensure that a TCP segment plus the TCP/IP header length will
fit into a single link-layer frame.
</p>

<p>
a typical value of MSS is 1460 bytes. Note that the MSS is the maximum amount of
application-layer data in the segment, not the maximum size of the TCP segment
including headers.
</p>

<p>
TCP pairs each chunk of client data with a TCP header, thereby forming <code>TCP
segments</code>. The segments are passed down to the network layer, where they are
separately encapsulated within network-layer IP datagrams. The IP datagrams are
then sent into the network. When TCP receives a segment at the other end, the
segment’s data is placed in the TCP connection’s receive buffer. The application
reads the stream of data from this buffer. Each side of the connection has its
own send buffer and its own receive buffer.
</p>

<p>
imagen 3.28
</p>

<p>
a TCP connection consists of buffers, variables, and a socket connection to a
process in one host, and another set of buffers, variables, and a socket
connection to a process in another host. As mentioned earlier, no buffers or
variables are allocated to the connection in the network elements (routers,
switches, and repeaters) between the hosts.

<h3 id="org24856e3"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> TCP Segment Structure</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
The TCP segment consists of header fields and a data field. The data field
contains a chunk of application data. As mentioned above, the MSS limits the
maximum size of a segment’s data field. When TCP sends a large file, such as an
image as part of a Web page, it typically breaks the file into chunks of size
MSS. Interactive applications, however, often transmit data chunks that are
smaller than the MSS;
</p>

<p>
the header includes source and <code>destination port numbers</code>, which are used for
multiplexing/demultiplexing data from/to upper-layer applications. Also, the
header includes a <code>checksum field</code>. A TCP segment header also contains the
following fields:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The 32-bit <code>sequence number field</code> and the 32-bit <code>acknowledgment number
  field</code> are used by the TCP sender and receiver in implementing a reliable data
transfer service, as discussed below.</li>
<li>The 16-bit <code>receive window field</code> is used for flow control. We will see
shortly that it is used to indicate the number of bytes that a receiver is

<li>The 4-bit <code>header length field</code> specifies the length of the TCP header in

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-1">
<p>
Two of the most important fields in the TCP segment header are the sequence
number field and the acknowledgment number field. These fields are a critical
part of TCP’s reliable data transfer service.
</p>

<p>
imagen 3.30
</p>

<p>
TCP views data as an unstructured, but ordered, stream of bytes. TCP’s use of
sequence numbers reflects this view in that sequence numbers are over the stream
of transmitted bytes and not over the series of transmitted segments. The
<code>sequence number for a segment</code> is therefore the byte-stream number of the first
byte in the segment.
</p>

<p>
Let’s look at an example. Suppose that a process in Host A wants to send a
stream of data to a process in Host B over a TCP connection. The TCP in Host A
will implicitly number each byte in the data stream. Suppose that the data
stream consists of a file consisting of 500,000 bytes, that the MSS is 1,000
bytes, and that the first byte of the data stream is numbered 0. As shown in
Figure 3.30, TCP constructs 500 segments out of the data stream. The first
segment gets assigned sequence number 0, the second segment gets assigned
sequence number 1,000, the third segment gets assigned sequence number 2,000,
and so on. Each sequence number is inserted in the sequence number field in the
header of the appropriate TCP segment.
</p>


<p>
Now let’s consider acknowledgment numbers. These are a little trickier than
sequence numbers. Recall that TCP is full-duplex, so that Host A may be
receiving data from Host B while it sends data to Host B (as part of the same
TCP connection). Each of the segments that arrive from Host B has a sequence
number for the data flowing from B to A. The acknowledgment number that Host A
puts in its segment is the sequence number of the next byte Host A is expecting
from Host B. It is good to look at a few examples to understand what is going on
here.
</p>

<p>
Suppose that Host A has received all bytes numbered 0 through 535 from B and
suppose that it is about to send a segment to Host B. Host A is waiting for byte
536 and all the subsequent bytes in Host B’s data stream. So Host A puts 536 in
the acknowledgment number field of the segment it sends to B.
</p>

<p>
As another example, suppose that Host A has received one segment from Host B
containing bytes 0 through 535 and another segment containing bytes 900 through
1,000. For some reason Host A has not yet received bytes 536 through 899. In
this example, Host A is still waiting for byte 536 (and beyond) in order to
re-create B’s data stream. Thus, A’s next segment to B will contain 536 in the
acknowledgment number field. Because TCP only acknowledges bytes up to the first
missing byte in the stream, TCP is said to provide <code>cumulative acknowledgments</code>.
</p>

<p>
Host A received the third segment (bytes 900 through 1,000) before receiving the
second segment (bytes 536 through 899). Thus, the third segment arrived out of
order. The subtle issue is: What does a host do when it receives out-of-order
segments in a TCP connection? Interestingly, the TCP RFCs do not impose any
rules here and leave the decision up to the programmers implementing a TCP
implementation. There are basically two choices: either (1) the receiver
immediately discards out-of-order segments (which, as we discussed earlier, can
simplify receiver design), or (2) the receiver keeps the out-of-order bytes and
waits for the missing bytes to fill in the gaps.
</p>

<p>
Both sides of a TCP connection randomly choose an initial sequence number. This
is done to minimize the possibility that a segment that is still present in the
network from an earlier, already-terminated connection between two hosts is
mistaken for a valid segment in a later connection between these same two hosts
(which also happen to be using the same port numbers as the old connection).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
TCP uses a timeout/retransmit mechanism to recover from lost segments.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the most obvious question is the length of the timeout intervals.
Clearly, the timeout should be larger than the connection’s round-trip time
(RTT), that is, the time from when a segment is sent until it is acknowledged.
Otherwise, unnecessary retransmissions would be sent.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org72fe250" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org72fe250"><span class="section-number-4">2.3.1</span> Estimating the Round-Trip Time</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-3-1">
<p>
The sample RTT, denoted SampleRTT , for a segment is the amount of time between
when the segment is sent (that is, passed to IP) and when an acknowledgment for
the segment is received. Instead of measuring a SampleRTT for every transmitted
segment, most TCP implementations take only one SampleRTT measurement at a time.
That is, at any point in time, the SampleRTT is being estimated for only one of
the transmitted but currently unacknowledged segments, leading to a new value of
SampleRTT approximately once every RTT. Also, TCP never computes a SampleRTT for
a segment that has been retransmitted; it only measures SampleRTT for segments
that have been transmitted once.
</p>


<p>
Obviously, the SampleRTT  values will fluctuate from segment to segment due to congestion in the
routers and to the varying load on the end systems. Because of this fluctuation, any given SampleRTT
value may be atypical. In order to estimate a typical RTT, it is therefore natural to take some sort of
average of the SampleRTT  values. TCP maintains an average, called EstimatedRTT , of the SampleRTT  values. Upon obtaining a new SampleRTT , TCP updates EstimatedRTT  according to the following formula:
</p>

<p>
\[EstimatedRTT = (1-\alpha)EstimatedRTT + \alpha SampleRTT\]
</p>

<p>
the new value of EstimatedRTT is a weighted combination of the previous value of
EstimatedRTT and the new value for SampleRTT. The recommended value of α is α =
0.125 (that is, 1/8) [RFC 6298]
</p>


<p>
In addition to having an estimate of the RTT, it is also valuable to have a
measure of the variability of the RTT. [RFC 6298] defines the RTT variation,
DevRTT , as an estimate of how much SampleRTT typically deviates from
EstimatedRTT :
</p>

<p>
\[DevRTT = (1-\beta)DevRTT + \beta |SampleRTT-EstimatedRTT|\]
</p>

<p>
The recommended value of &beta; is 0.25

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">

In our earlier development of reliable data transfer techniques, it was
conceptually easiest to assume that an individual timer is associated with each
transmitted but not yet acknowledged segment. While this is great in theory,
timer management can require considerable overhead. Thus, the recommended TCP
timer management procedures [RFC 6298] use only a single retransmission timer,
even if there are multiple transmitted but not yet acknowledged segments.

<p>
Host A sends one segment to Host B. Suppose that this segment has sequence
number 92 and contains 8 bytes of data. After sending this segment, Host A waits
for a segment from B with acknowledgment number 100. Although the segment from A
is received at B, the acknowledgment from B to A gets lost. In this case, the
timeout event occurs, and Host A retransmits the same segment. Of course, when
Host B receives the retransmission, it observes from the sequence number that
the segment contains data that has already been received. Thus, TCP in Host B
will discard the bytes in the retransmitted segment.
</p>

<p>
imagen 3.35
</p>

<p>
Host A sends two segments back to back. The first segment has sequence number 92
and 8 bytes of data, and the second segment has sequence number 100 and 20 bytes
of data. Suppose that both segments arrive intact at B, and B sends two separate
acknowledgments for each of these segments. The first of these acknowledgments
has acknowledgment number 100; the second has acknowledgment number 120. Suppose
now that neither of the acknowledgments arrives at Host A before the timeout.
When the timeout event occurs, Host A resends the first segment with sequence
number 92 and restarts the timer. As long as the ACK for the second segment
arrives before the new timeout, the second segment will not be retransmitted.
</p>

<p>
imagen 3.36
</p>

<p>
Host A sends the two segments, exactly as in the second example. The acknowledgment of the first segment is lost in the network, but before the timeout event, Host A receives an acknowledgment with acknowledgement number 120. Host A therefore knows that Host B has received everything up through byte 119; so Host A does not resend either of the two segments.

<p>
whenever the timeout event occurs, TCP retransmits the not-yet-acknowledged
segment with the smallest sequence number, as described above. But each time TCP
retransmits, it sets the next timeout interval to twice the previous
value,rather than deriving it from the last EstimatedRTT and DevRTT.
</p>

<p>
This modification provides a limited form of congestion control. The timer
expiration is most likely caused by congestion in the network, that is, too many
packets arriving at one (or more) router queues in the path between the source
and destination, causing packets to be dropped and/or long queuing delays. In
times of congestion, if the sources continue to retransmit packets persistently,
the congestion may get worse. Instead, TCP acts more politely, with each sender
retransmitting after longer and longer intervals.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-4-3">
<p>
timeout-triggered retransmissions can be relatively long. When a segment is
lost, this long timeout period forces the sender to delay resending the lost
packet, thereby increasing the end-to-end delay. Fortunately, the sender can
often detect packet loss well before the timeout event occurs by noting
so-called duplicate ACKs. A <code>duplicate ACK</code> is an ACK that reacknowledges a
segment for which the sender has already received an earlier acknowledgment.
</p>


<p>
To understand the sender’s response to a duplicate ACK, we must look at why the receiver sends a
duplicate ACK in the first place.

<p>
When a TCP receiver receives a segment with a sequence number that is larger
than the next, expected, in-order sequence number, it detects a gap in the data
stream—that is, a missing segment. This gap could be the result of lost or
reordered segments within the network. Since TCP does not use negative
acknowledgments, the receiver cannot send an explicit negative acknowledgment
back to the sender. Instead, it simply reacknowledges (that is, generates a
duplicate ACK for) the last in-order byte of data it has received.
</p>

<p>
If the TCP sender receives three duplicate ACKs for the same data, it takes this
as an indication that the segment following the segment that has been ACKed
three times has been lost. In the case that three duplicate ACKs are received,
the TCP sender performs a <code>fast retransmit</code> [RFC 5681], retransmitting the
missing segment before that segment’s timer expires. This is shown in Figure
3.37, where the second segment is lost, then retransmitted before its timer
expires.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-4-4">
<p>
Is TCP a GBN or an SR protocol?
</p>

<p>
Recall that TCP acknowledgments are cumulative and correctly received but
out-of-order segments are not individually ACKed by the receiver. the TCP sender
need only maintain the smallest sequence number of a transmitted but
unacknowledged byte ( SendBase ) and the sequence number of the next byte to be
sent ( NextSeqNum ). In this sense, TCP looks a lot like a GBN-style protocol.
</p>

<p>
But there are some striking differences between TCP and Go-Back-N. Many TCP
implementations will buffer correctly received but out-of-order segments
[Stevens 1994]. Consider also what happens when the sender sends a sequence of
segments 1, 2, . . ., N, and all of the segments arrive in order without error
at the receiver. Further suppose that the acknowledgment for packet gets lost,
but the remaining acknowledgments arrive at the sender before their respective
timeouts. In this example, GBN would retransmit not only packet n, but also all
of the subsequent packets TCP, on the other hand, would retransmit at most one
segment, namely, segment n. Moreover, TCP would not even retransmit segment n if
the acknowledgment for segment arrived before the timeout for segment n.
</p>

<p>
A proposed modification to TCP, the so-called selective acknowledgment [RFC
2018], allows a TCP receiver to acknowledge out-of-order segments selectively
rather than just cumulatively acknowledging the last correctly received,
in-order segment. When combined with selective retransmission—skipping the
retransmission of segments that have already been selectively acknowledged by
the receiver—TCP looks a lot like our generic SR protocol.
</p>

<p>
TCP’s error-recovery mechanism is probably best categorized as a hybrid of GBN
and SR protocols.
